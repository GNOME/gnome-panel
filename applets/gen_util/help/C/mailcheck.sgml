      You don't need to do anything in particular to run this applet.
      Providing it is looking in the right place for your email, it
      will run itself quite happily. The following options, however,
      are available:

       The mailcheck <interface>properties dialogue box</interface> is
       divided into two sections, one for what the mail check applet
       does, and one for where it checks for email.

         The mail check options have six sections:

         <term>Execute...before each update</term>
         <listitem>
          <para>
            Sometimes you may want to run something such as
            <application>fetchmail</application> before the applet 
            checks for new mail. To do this, check the checkbox and
            fill in the program name in the space here.

          <para>
            Sometimes you may want other programs to run when new mail
            arrives. It is common to tell the machine to play a noise 
            at you, for example. Checking this checkbox and filling in
            the command (such as <command>mpg123 sillynoise.mpg</command>
            or <command>esdplay sillynoise.wav</command>) will let this
            happen.

          <para>
            By putting a program name (generally a mail-reader such as
            <application>balsa</application> or <application>spruce</application>
            here and clicking on the checkbox, you can set things up so that
            when you click <mousebutton>button 1</mousebutton> on the 
            applet, that program will be automatically run.

          <para>
            You can adjust the range for checking whether mail has arrived
            between 1440 minutes (once a day) to never. Setting it to never
            is silly and will confuse it. The default value is every two
            minutes.

           for the mailbox, then you can fill in the details on which file
           or directory the applet should check for new email. You can only
           put one filename here. The section about mail servers will be
           greyed out.

           When remote POP3 or remote IMAP are selected as the location for

           username and password. If the you don't supply the password, the
           applet will ask for it when it first tries to check for mail.
           The section about local filenames will be greyed out.

       If you use a mail filter such as <application>procmail</application>,
