  <title>GNOME Pager Manual</title>
 <!-- According to GFDL, the Title Page "should use  a title distinct from that of 
      the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were 
      any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same 
      title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives 
      permission." An easy way to satisfy this requirement (if you do
      not have orginal publisher's permission)  is to include version
      number as part of the title, e.g. MY-GNOME-APP V2.0

     &app; proves mathematical theorems.  &app; has all the basic features
     expected from a mathematical theorem prover. &app; also has a number
     of advanced features, such as proof by confusion.  Many of
     the proofs produced by &app; 
     are so complex they are capable of proving almost anything
     with a virtually null likelihood of being disproven. It also has
     the popular predecessor of proof by confusion, proof by
     dialog, first implemented by Plato.</para>
