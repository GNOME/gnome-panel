     In addition to the standard menu items (see <xref

     the following items:

      <listitem>
       <para>
        <guimenuitem>Properties...</guimenuitem> &mdash; This menu

        customize the appearance and behavior of this applet.

     You can configure <application>printer</application> applet by
     right-clicking on the applet and choosing the
     <guimenuitem>Properties...</guimenuitem> menu item. This will open the
     <interface>Properties</interface> dialog, shown in <xref

    <para> 

    To change the label displayed at the bottom of the
    <application>printer</application> applet, ("Print" in <xref
    linkend="printer-fig">) type a new name in the <guilabel>Printer
    name</guilabel> field.  This setting is useful if you have more than one
    printer available for use and wish to add a
    <application>printer</application> applet to the
    <interface>Panel</interface> for each printer. The <guilabel>Printer
    name</guilabel> does not determine which printer your file will be printed
    to, it exists as an easy means to to distinguish between printers should you
    have more than one <application>printer</application> applet installed on
    your <interface>Panel</interface>.


    </para>
    
    <para>
    
    To change the command the <application>printer</application> applet uses to
    print your files, you may enter a new command in the <guilabel>Print
    command</guilabel> field.  By default, the <application>printer
    </application> applet uses the command <command>lpr</command>, which is
    common to many systems.  Your system may use a different command.  If you're
    unsure, check your system's documentation.
    
    <note>

    <title>Note for advanced users</title>

    <para> 

    If you have more than one printer, you may designate which printer to send
    files to by changing the <guilabel>Print command</guilabel> setting.  For
    instance, if your system uses the command <command>lpr</command> to print
    files and you need to print your file on the printer named "ljet5", you
    would change the <guilabel>Print command</guilabel> setting to <command>lpr
    -Pljet5</command>.
