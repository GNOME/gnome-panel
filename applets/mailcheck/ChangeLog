Fri Mar 19 12:48:41 1999  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

 	close_hides property on the window.

	* battery/battery.c (make_new_battery_applet): Set bat->setup

	  time in the way it was meant to be displayed

1999-02-22  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* multiload: Resize the widget after changing the size in the
	properties dialog. Add "destroy" signal handler to the load
	graph and correctly destroy it so it will no longer dump core
	when you remove on of the applets.

	the multiload applet honor the width and height settings in
	the properties dialog on next startup.

1999-02-15  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	bit less subtle.

1999-02-04  Nat Friedman  <nat@nat.org>

	* battery/read-battery.c (battery_read_charge): The Linux support
 	has been completely rewritten.  I am now caching the fd of
 	/proc/apm, and then using dup() when I need to fetch new battery
 	data to ensure that we only call open() once.  Now the battery
 	applet never touches the disk while it's running.  Nice for laptops.

	* battery/properties.c (col_value_changed_cb): New function.
	(adj_value_changed_cb): Likewise.
	(col_value_changed_cb): Likewise.  This fixes a bug as reported by

 	immediately.

	* battery/battery.h: Added force_update.

	(battery_setup_picture): More readable.
	(battery_set_size): Call battery_update.

1999-02-03  Jonathan Blandford  <jrb@redhat.com>

	* mixer/vslider.c (vslider_class_init): now we no longer draw the
	trough, and let mixer.c handle that.  VOILA! no more flashes. (:
	* mixer/hslider.c (hslider_class_init):ditto
	
1999-02-02  Jonathan Blandford  <jrb@redhat.com>

	* mixer/mixer.c (create_computer_mixer_widget): make the

	  build as it hasnt been finished, removed fvwm pager from build as it 
	  should become gnome compiant with patches sometime...

1999-01-08  Christopher Blizzard  <blizzard@appliedtheory.com>

1999-01-06  Nat Friedman  <nat@nat.org>

	* Makefile.am (always_built_SUBDIRS): Removed the batmon applet
 	from the applet list.

Tue Dec 29 14:40:25 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Build fvwm-pager applet unconditionally.

1998-12-28  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	The "MultiLoad Applet Revolution".

	All three multiload applets (cpuload, memload, swapload) now use
	the same load graph object and the same properties code.

	This will make it much easier to add a new applet here.
	
	* multiload/cpuload.h: Removed.

1998-12-28  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* cpuload: Removed this applet. It has been replaced with the
	multiload applet.

1998-12-26  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* asclock/timezone.c: If /etc/localtime exists, read default
	timezone from it and select it in the clist.

	* asclock/dialogs.c: Removed useless 'General' properties tab.
	* asclock/main.c: Use stock callbacks.

1998-12-25  Jeff Garzik  <jgarzik@pobox.com>

1998-12-18  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* netload/properties.c (apply_cb): incorporated Daniel Burrows'
	patch to fix a properties bug: the memcopy() was not enough to

	said.

1998-12-15  Yukihiro Nakai<Nakai@abricot.co.jp>

	* Added the Japanese [ja] translation entries with
	our special tool.

1998-12-14  Matt Wilson  <msw@redhat.com>

	* multiload/properties-mem.c: No C++ comments!

1998-12-14  Christopher Blizzard  <blizzard@appliedtheory.com>

	* Makefile.am: Disable the bussign.  Doesn't work.  Shouldn't
 	really be part of 1.0.

1998-12-13  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	Following a suggestion from Richard Hult it is confusing users
	to have to cpuload monitors that look exactly the same and to
	have an extra level of menus for the multiload applet.
 	
	So replaced the cpuload applet with the multiload which is no
	longer hidden in a submenu.

	* multiload/Multiload.directory: Removed.
	* multiload/Makefile.am: Don't use an extra level of menus for
	the multiload applet, put all .desktop files to the other monitor
	applets.

	* cpuload: This has been replaced with the multiload applet.

1998-12-13  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* netload.c: Always use LibGTop to get the data.

Mon Dec 07 02:17:08 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* */*.c: fixed up includes, removed applet-lib.h and added
	  applet-widget.h where missing

Mon Dec 07 01:05:22 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* cdplayer/cdplayer.c: use abort_load applet widget call instead
	  of a call which was directly into the applet-lib (which doesn't
	  exist any more)

Thu Dec 03 02:42:00 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* */*.c: replaced applet_widget_new_with_param, and changed all
	  multiapplets to follow the current panel stuff

Tue Dec  1 10:05:50 MET 1998 Sven Neumann <svenqgimp.org>

	* gen_util/clock.c: added a configuration option that
	allows to hide the date.

Sun Nov 29 18:20:54 EST 1998 Gregory McLean <gregm@comstar.net>

	* gticker: applet api changes.

Sun Nov 29 17:15:17 EST 1998 Gregory McLean <gregm@comstar.net>

	* slashapp: applet api changes.
	Lord only knows if it will work, but they compile now.

1998-11-28  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* netload: replaced gnome_color_selector() with
	gnome_color_picker().  Worked on making the properties and the
	level bars in the graph work.  Also removed some compiler
	warnings.

	* netload/properties.c (create_general_frame): the properties
	dialog is now set up with gnome_color_picker_new() instead of the
	old gnome_color_selector_new() stuff.

	* netload/properties.c, netload/netload.c: removed the rescaling
	of the line_spacing by 1024.

	* netload/properties.c (load_properties): changed some default
	values: gcolor and bcolor are now such that you can see the bars
	on the graph.  line_spacing never used to give any line spacing on
	dialup connections, so I rescaled the whole thing and set the
	default to be 2, which works well for a modem line.
	(gcolor_changed_cb, bcolor_changed_cb): replaced the previous
	color_changed-cb() function with these two, one per color.  The
	previous one did not work and had a memory leak; this approach
	seems to work and is like the one in the multiload applet.

1998-11-22  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* netload: This applet now requires LibGTop >= 0.26.5.
	If you have an older version of LibGTop, the original code
 	will be used but only until the next release of LibGTop.

1998-11-23  Christopher Blizzard  <blizzard@appliedtheory.com>

	* asclock/dialogs.c (properties_dialog): Comment out
 	gtk_clist_set_policy().  This should compile now.
	
1998-11-21  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* cpuload/cpuload.c (main): Nice the process.  Also, fixed
	compiler warnings.

	* cpumemusage/cpumemusage.c (update_mem_values): New function to
	update the memory/swap values.
	(cpumemusage_widget): Now the memory/swap values are updated at a
	different rate than the CPU one.  Walking the kernel page table to
	gather memory information is expensive, so we only do it once a
	second instead of every 200 milliseconds.
	(main): Nice the process.

	* cpumemusage/procbar.c (procbar_configure): Now the GC is created
	here, instead of in procbar_set_values(), to save a bit of time.

	* cpumemusage/procbar.h (ProcBar): Added a gc field.

1998-11-14  Jaka Mocnik  <jaka.mocnik@kiss.uni-lj.si>

	* multiload/properties-*.c, drivemount/properties.c,
	netload/properties.c, diskusage/properties.c,
	clockmail/properties.c, modemlights/properties.c:
	connected "changed" signal of spin buttons to code
	that enables property box apply and ok buttons.
	patches provided by Richard Hult.

1998-11-12  Jaka Mocnik  <jaka.mocnik@kiss.uni-lj.si>

	* gen_util/mailcheck.c (mailcheck_properties_page): connected "changed"
	signal of mc->spin spinbutton to property_box_changed.

Wed Nov 11 17:56:25 EST 1998 Gregory McLean <gregm@comstar.net>
	
	* cpuload/properties.c : Migrated to GnomeColorPicker vs
