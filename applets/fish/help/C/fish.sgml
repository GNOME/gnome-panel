  <title>The GNOME fish applet</title>

  <para>
    The <application>GNOME fish applet</application> displays a small
    fish in your <interface>panel</interface> and does nothing useful 
    whatsoever beyond that. It is part of the gnome-core package. This 
    description of it refers to the fish as displayed in gnome-core-1.1.2.
  </para>
  <para>
    It is occasionally found in the <interface>panel</interface> anyway, 
    but if you don't see it, you can start it by clicking <mousebutton>button
    3</mousebutton> on an empty part of the <interface>panel</interface>
    and following the sequence
   <menuchoice>
   <guimenu>Applets</guimenu>
    <guisubmenu>Amusements</guisubmenu>
    <guimenuitem>Fish</guimenuitem>
   </menuchoice>
  </para>
  <para>
    The fish applet was written by George Lebl (<email>jirka@5z.com</email>). 
    Please report bugs in it to the
    <ulink type="http" url="http://bugs.gnome.org">GNOME bug tracking 
    system</ulink>. You can do this by following the guidelines on that site 
    or by using <command>bug-buddy</command> from the command-line. 
    For the package, put gnome-core.

   <title>Usage</title>

   <para>
     Unlike most fishes, this fish requires little care and no fishbowl
     cleaning. It swims happily about in its water. If you ask it, it
     will tell you interesting thoughts. Various options are available
     with the mouse:

     <listitem>
      <para>
        This checkbox is used for vertical panels, and when checked, the
        fish will appear swimming downwards on a vertical panel. If it is 
        not checked, it will appear the same way as on a horizontal panel,
        which forces the vertical panel to widen to accomodate it.
