   <title>Usage</title>

      <listitem>
       <para>
        Your GNOME Fish's Name &mdash;  You can change your fish's
        name here. The default name is Wanda. 
       </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>
        The Animation Filename &mdash; You can select a different set
        of pictures here. By default,
        the list of pictures is in <filename>$PREFIX/pixmaps/fish/</filename>,
        which you can browse and choose from. You may also put a different
        pathname in pointing to your own pictures.
       </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>

      <listitem>
       <para>
        Rotate on vertical panels &mdash; This checkbox is used for
        vertical panels, and when checked, the
        fish will appear swimming downwards on a vertical panel. If it is 
        not checked, it will appear the same way as on a horizontal panel,
        which forces the vertical panel to widen to accomodate it.
       </para>
      </listitem>


     </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <para> 
      After you have made all the changes you want, click on
