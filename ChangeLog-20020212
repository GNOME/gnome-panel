1998-07-13  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* configure.in (mico_prefix): Stop searching as soon as a
	`mico-ld' is found.  From Michael Lausch <mla@gams.co.at>.

Fri Jun 12 22:56:58 1998  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: Look for mico-setup.sh in $mico_prefix/doc.  Also,
	handle MICO 2.0.3 (still!).

1998-06-11  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* configure.in: added gmenu/Makefile

1998-06-11  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* gmenu directory: Checked in a gmenu, the GNOME menu editor,
	still needs a Makefile.am file though.

Wed Jun 10 11:34:52 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* configure.in: Make panel link micocoss library as well

Wed Jun 10 11:34:52 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* configure.in acconfig.h: Check for installed MICO
	  version, and the libs it requires by using mico-ld 
	  and mico-setup.sh.

	  Add a HAVE_MICO_ORB_RUN macro to signal that we need
	  to call orb->run(), as we do for mico-2.0.6 and later

Tue Jun  9 23:37:43 EDT 1998 Gregory McLean <gregm@comstar.net>

	* .cvsignore updates.

	with gtk1.1

1998-06-05  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* core-docs/Makefile.am: fixed it so that "make dist" will
	generate a reasonable distribution.  Many files were not listed in
	the EXTRAS, but I think they now are.

1998-05-30  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* configure.in (FALSE): Automake conditional that always fails.
	This is used in some subdir Makefile.am tricks.

1998-05-26  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* configure.in: added PROGRAMS_PANEL_MODEMLIGHTS, apparently
	net/ppp_defs.h does not exist on solaris.

	* configure.in: added GNOME_FILEUTILS_CHECKS

	* acconfig.h (AFS, MOUNTED_FREAD, MOUNTED_FREAD_FSTYP,
	MOUNTED_GETFSSTAT, MOUNTED_GETMNT, MOUNTED_GETMNTENT1,
	MOUNTED_GETMNTENT2, MOUNTED_GETMNTINFO, MOUNTED_LISTMNTENT,
	MOUNTED_VMOUNT, STAT_STATFS3_OSF1, STAT_READ_FILSYS,
	STAT_STATFS2_BSIZE, STAT_STATFS2_FSIZE, STAT_STATFS2_FS_DATA,
	STAT_STATFS4, STAT_STATVFS, STATFS_TRUNCATES_BLOCK_COUNTS):
	New macros.
	
1998-05-13  Christopher Blizzard  <blizzard@appliedtheory.com>

	* configure.in: added applets/bussign/Makefile to the list of
 	Makefiles.

1998-05-05  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* core-docs/gnome-intro.sgml: added a bit more to the panel;
	that's it for the Red Hat 5.1 release, I guess.

	* core-docs/Makefile.am (install-data-local): fixed little bug in
	installing help files.

	* core-docs/gnome-intro.sgml: completed the GNOME intro; there are
	many omissions, but it seems OK.  Now I have to proofread it a bit
	and add a mention of panel applets.  I also added all the
	generated HTML files for people who do not have the docbook tools
	installed (this sucks).

	* core-docs/Makefile.am: put core-docs under automake with some
	quickly hacked-up rules for the RH-5.1 release.  I will clean it
	up later; this seems to work and install gnome-intro in a way such
	that the help browser picks it up.

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): added core-docs

Sun May  3 22:43:59 1998  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	overall gnome-intro manual.

Mon Apr 27 20:42:24 EDT 1998 Gregory McLean <gregm@comstar.net>

	* panel/menu.c : changed a couple of <icon>.xpm to <icon.png> as
	  the xpm files for _thoose_ icons wern't there.

Sun Apr 26 10:55:18 EDT 1998 Gregory McLean <gregm@comstar.net>
	
	* Its too early in the morning!

	* applets/netwatch/netwatch_applet.desktop: desktop file
	* applets/netwatch/.cvsignore: updated.

	* configure.in: Added --with-window-manager option.

	* configure.in: Unconditionally look for crypt.h.

Sun Apr 26 10:55:18 EDT 1998 Gregory McLean <gregm@comstar.net>

	* configure.in: changed the AC_PROG_LEX -> AM_PROG_LEX
	  though I couldn't find any lex files that this is needed
	  for. IIRC automake 1.2 supports this macro also.

        * applets/*/.cvsignore: updated to ignore generated files.

	* panel.c,clock.c: fixed some FIXME's and added some 
	  sanity checks

1998-02-25  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>
