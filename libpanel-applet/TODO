libpanel-applet todo list
=========================

	Things that need to be finished before this library can be considered
anyway complete.

	* Save applets size position etc, and reload when panel starts up.

	* Size negotiation. Basically make sure this works. It should be no
	  different than the usual GtkWidget size request/allocation. The
	  applets shouldn't be allowed to be any bigger than the panel. The
	  other issue is with applets that want to expand to fill the available
	  space on the panel. At the moment this is solved with getExpandFlags,
	  but this ends up with some freaky stuff going on when you're moving
	  applets. Maybe we should consider having a re-sizable flag which would
	  make the applets have grabs for re-sizing.

	* Middle mouse button dragging doesn't seem to work for some reason. The
	  button presses are being forwarded in BonoboPlug so its is some other
	  issue.

	* The whole thing leaks like a three week old baby.

	* The popup menu doesn't appear outside of the panel. Use
	  bonobo_control_do_popup_full.

	* We need a replacement for the "Applet Died - Reload ?" dialog box.
