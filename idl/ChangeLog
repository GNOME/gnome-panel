	* gnome-panel.idl: add the size hints

1999-04-25  Jacob Berkman  <jberk+@cmu.edu>

	* gnomecc.gnorba, control-center.idl: removed these files;
	they are in the control center module

1998-12-15  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* Makefile.am (idl_DATA): Added help-browser.idl.

Mon Dec 07 01:52:52 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnome-panel.idl: make a lot of the calls oneway which should
	  improve performance especially on calls that are done to
	  all applets at once (plus it should reduce panel hanging when
	  the applet hangs I'd guess, except for saving which needs to
	  be synchronious)

Sun Dec 06 13:43:04 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnome-panel.idl: remove request_globcfg

1998-12-04  Andrew T. Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* gnome-panel.idl: Change ``object'' in applet_register to
	``Object'' since this is an IDL keyword (IDL keywords are
	case-sensitive).

Thu Dec 03 02:42:44 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnome-panel.idl: changed the interface not to pass params but
	  goad_id's

1998-09-24  Nuno Ferreira  <nmrf@rnl.ist.utl.pt>

	* .cvsignore: Added this file.

1998-09-23  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* Makefile.am: New file.  WHY DID THIS STUPID DIRECTORY NOT HAVE A
	MAKEFILE.AM IN IT!?
