#. Translators:
#. This controls whether the GNOME panel clock should display time in 24 hour mode
#. or 12 hour mode by default. The only valid values for this are "24-hour" and
#. "12-hour". If your locale uses 24 hour time notation, translate this to "24-hour".
#. If your locale uses 12 hour time notation with am/pm, translate this to "12-hour".
#.
#. Do NOT translate this into anything else than "24-hour" or "12-hour". For example,
#. if you translate this to "24 sata" or anything else that isn't "24-hour" or
#. "12-hour", things will not work.
