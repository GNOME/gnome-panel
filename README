gnome-panel 2.26.0
==================

This package is free software and is part of the GNOME 2.0 project.

The package contains the GNOME panel which is the area on your desktop from
which you can run applications and applets, and perform other tasks.

The libpanel-applet library is also in this package. This library allows one to
develop small applications which may be embedded in the panel. These are called
applet.

Several applets are also supplied - the Workspace Switcher, the Window List,
the Window Selector, the Notification Area, the Clock and the infamous 'Wanda
the Fish'.
