    <title>Panel Applet Library Overview</title>
    <partintro>
      <para>
        The Panel Applet Library is used in the GNOME Flashback desktop to write applets that can be added to GNOME
        Panel. GNOME Panel is the main user interface used in the GNOME Flashback desktop environment, through which
        users interact with their computer and open applications.
      </para>

      <para>
        Applets are small applications that are embedded in the GNOME Panel. They can be used to give quick access
        to some features, or to display the state of something specific. Most features in GNOME Panel such as the clock,
        the application menu, the calendar and many others are written with this Panel Applet Library. Applets are added
        through the "Add to Panel" dialog which can be opened from the "Add to Panel..." option on the context menu of
        a GNOME Panel.

      <para>
        The Panel Applet Library is what should be used to write applets as it handles all the communication with
        the GNOME panel. It hides all of the embedding process of the applet behind a
        <link linkend="PanelApplet"><type>PanelApplet</type></link> widget. It also provides
        <link linkend="reference"><type>PanelApplet API</type></link> to properly integrate the applet in the
        panel.
      </para>

      <note>
        <simpara>
          The Panel Applet Library was original part of the default GNOME desktop but was deprecated with GNOME 3,
          when GNOME Shell was released. Nowadays development continues as part of the GNOME Flashback project. The
          default desktop of GNOME now uses GNOME Shell, which uses a different system for extension, so an applet
          written with the Panel Applet Library will not be usable in the default GNOME that users may use.

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>
     While applets are rather simple to write, they are not the most easy form of interaction to users for two reasons:
     <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            It is not intuitive how to add or remove applets for many users, so users may not know about your applet,
            or may not know how to add it to the GNOME Panel.
        </listitem>
         <listitem>
            The restriction in size of applets can limit their interface, so you should only use applets for simple
            tasks such as displaying information, or for controlling other applications and programs.
         </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
     Therefore, before writing an applet, think hard whether this is the form of interaction that
     is best for the feature you want to provide.

    <title>Concepts</title>

       <para>
         In order to write an applet it is important to understand the relationships between GNOME Panel and your
         applets. For example, how are applets registered to the GNOME Panel? How does the GNOME Panel instantiate an
         applet?
       </para>
       <para>
         On a typical desktop there can be multiple GNOME Panels and each GNOME Panel can have several instances of
         your applet. These different instances are created by an <emphasis>applet factory</emphasis> which must be
         registered to the GNOME Panel. Additionally, in order to identify your applet and instantiate the correct
         applet, each applet is identified by an <emphasis>applet type</emphasis>.
       </para>

       <sect1>
           <title>Applet Registration</title>

           <para>
             To make your applets and the applet factory known to GNOME Panel - so that it can show your
             applet in the list of applets of the "Add to Panel" dialog - and to add applets to the panel, you
             must create a Panel Applet File.
             <link linkend="getting-started.install.panel-applet">Panel Applet files</link> are introduced in more
             detail later in this document. However it is important for applet authors to understand the relationship
             between <emphasis>the panel applet file</emphasis>, <emphasis>the applet factory</emphasis>, and the
             <emphasis>applet type</emphasis>. Therefore this section contains a short example of a Panel Applet file.

                 The applet factory is an implementation detail that is mostly hidden by the Panel Applet Library,
                 but it still appears in a few places such as:

                   The applet factory is the object that will create a new applet instance when the panel requests a
                   new applet to be created. It is identified with a simple string id, for example
                   <constant>HelloWorldFactory</constant>.

                   The requests the applet factory will receive from the GNOME Panel specify which type of applet should be created.
                   This is what makes it possible to have more than one applet type in one applet binary. In most cases, however, the
                   applet factory will be specific to only one applet type.

               <para>
                   There is only one applet factory per applet binary, and it is always running before any applet instance is
                   created by the applet binary. The applet factory is created via one of these two macros:

               There is no restriction as to how many instances of one applet type can be created. The user might
               choose to add more than one <constant>HelloWorldApplet</constant> applets to his panels. This can
               have some implications on the design used to write applets. The most important implication is that
               it is generally wrong to have global variables to keep a state specific to an applet instance.

                   <simpara>
                       Using global variables in an applet can cause problems when the applet is instantiated
                       several times.

      In this section we will write a simple example applet. This simple applet will have no functionality and
      only displays a label with "Hello World" on the panel. For this simple applet only following three parts
      are needed:

      instance private structure, among other benefits. Most of the code below is related to the GObject system
      and needed to subclass the Panel Applet. The only noteworthy difference is that the

     <title>Guidelines for Context Menu</title>

     <para>
      To help guarantee consistency in the interaction with applets, there are some guidelines that are recommended to follow:
     </para>

     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        Do not make the context menu too long: if you have more than five or six menu items, then it might be worth investing efforts on rethinking what is important in the menu.
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        For the menu item that will enable the user to configure the applet, use "Preferences" for the label, and try to avoid "Configure", "Configuration", "Settings", etc.
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        Avoid putting a "Help" menu item. The user will usually explicitly add the applet, so it is expected that he knows what the applet is about. Putting a "Help" menu item in the context menu is therefore too prominent. It might make sense to add a "Help" button in the Preferences dialog, though.
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        If you agree, avoid putting a "About" menu item. To the user, applets are not different applications but elements of one global application, the panel. Of course, this means that credits for working on the applet are not visible to the user.

     <title>Setting Up the Menu</title>

     <para>
      To setup the context menu of the applet, the <link linkend="panel-applet-setup-menu-from-file"><function>panel_applet_setup_menu_from_file()</function></link> function should be used, with a path to a <link linkend="getting-started.context-menu.xml-file">menu XML file</link> and a <type>GtkActionGroup</type> object containing all actions that are used in the menu XML file.

    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Global settings: those are settings that should be shared among all instances of the same applets. For instance, the preferred unit for temperature is something that the user will want to set only one. The way to store those settings is in no way specific to the Panel Applet library, as it should work like in any other application.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Per-applet instance settings: those are settings that might be different depending on the instance of an applet. For instance, an applet whose goal is to display a picture should make it possible for the user to choose a different picture for each instance of the applet. The Panel Applet library provides API to help with this.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>
     There is actually a third case, which is rather rare, though: per-screen settings. It might be that some applets control some per-screen settings, like the layout of the workspaces. There is currently no API to help with this as it is a very specific case that you will probably never have to deal with for a usual applet.

     <para>
      The communication between the panel and the applet factory is done over D-Bus. When creating an applet, the panel will send a message to the D-Bus service of the applet factory. If the D-Bus service is not running yet, it must be started automatically. We use D-Bus activation for this, which requires install a standard D-Bus service file. Please refer to the <ulink url="http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#message-bus-starting-services">D-Bus documentation</ulink> for more information about D-Bus service files.

    <title>Proper Integration with the Panel</title>

    <para>
     Since the applets appear as part of the panel to users, it is important that they behave in a consistent way. A few steps can be completed to achieve proper integration.
    </para>

    <sect2 id="getting-started.integration.background">
     <title>Panel Background</title>

     <para>
     The panel can have different types of background, depending on how the user configures the panel. By default, applets do not respect the background that is configured and can therefore look out of place.
     </para>

     <para>
      The <link linkend="panel-applet-set-background-widget"><function>panel_applet_set_background_widget()</function></link> function can be used to automatically have the right background drawn for a specific widget. Just using this function on the <link linkend="PanelApplet"><type>PanelApplet</type></link> object itself, or its child is usually enough to have proper background integration.
     </para>

     <para>
      In some rare cases, though, <link linkend="panel-applet-set-background-widget"><function>panel_applet_set_background_widget()</function></link> will not be enough. The solution is then to connect to the <link linkend="PanelApplet-change-background"><function>"change-background"</function></link> signal of the <link linkend="PanelApplet"><type>PanelApplet</type></link> object: it will be emitted when the background has changed, and it will provide the <type>cairo_pattern_t</type> pattern to use as a basis to draw the background.
     </para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="getting-started.integration.lockdown">
     <title>Panel Lockdown</title>

     <para>
      The panel has proper support for lockdown, and when it is locked down, it is expected that all applets behave consistently in a lockdown mode too. This generally means that the preferences of the applet should not be accessible, but it could also imply a restriction on the behavior of the applet.
     </para>

     <para>
      The <link linkend="panel-applet-get-locked-down"><function>panel_applet_get_locked_down()</function></link> function can be used to query the state of the panel lockdown. It is also possible to react to changes by monitoring the <link linkend="PanelApplet--locked-down"><function>"locked-down"</function></link> property of the <link linkend="PanelApplet"><type>PanelApplet</type></link> object. You can achieve this by connecting to the <function>"notify::locked-down"</function> event.
     </para>

     <para>
       In most cases, the <type>GBinding</type> API is enough to respect the panel lockdown: <function>g_object_bind_property()</function> can be used to automatically update the visiblity of a menu item in the context menu of the applet. In the following example, the <function>"HelloWorldPrefs"</function> action (which is an action from the context menu) will only be displayed if the panel is not locked down.

      <informalexample>
       <programlisting language="c">
action = gtk_action_group_get_action (action_group, "HelloWorldPrefs");
g_object_bind_property (applet, "locked-down",
                        action, "visible",
                        G_BINDING_DEFAULT|G_BINDING_INVERT_BOOLEAN|G_BINDING_SYNC_CREATE);
       </programlisting>
      </informalexample>

      <para>
       It is obviously possible to use <function>g_object_bind_property()</function> to change the visibility of widgets that appear outside of the context menu, like a button in a window.
      </para>

     </para>

   </chapter>

   <chapter id="getting-started.in-out-process">
    <title>Out-of-Process vs In-Process</title>

    <para>
     Applets can either live in their own process ("out-of-process") or in the panel process ("in-process"). The decision to choose one or the other is done at build time, with the macro that you use to define the applet factory: <link linkend="PANEL-APPLET-OUT-PROCESS-FACTORY:CAPS"><function>PANEL_APPLET_OUT_PROCESS_FACTORY()</function></link> is used for out-of-process applets while <link linkend="PANEL-APPLET-IN-PROCESS-FACTORY:CAPS"><function>PANEL_APPLET_IN_PROCESS_FACTORY()</function></link> is used for in-process applets. Obviously, only one of those two macros can be used.
    </para>

    <para>
      For most practical matters, from the applet perspective, the two options are the same. In-process applets do offer a slightly better performance when the applet is loaded, but this should not affect much the user experience. However, an in-process applet can potentially affect the whole behavior of the panel, especially in case of crashes or memory corruptions: a crash in an in-process applet will crash the whole panel. It is therefore recommended to use out-of-process applets.

   <chapter id="getting-started.introspection">
    <title>Writing an applet in languages other than C</title>

    <para>
     The Panel Applet library comes with support for <ulink url="http://live.gnome.org/GObjectIntrospection">GObject Introspection</ulink>. This makes it possible to write applets in the languages that have <ulink url="http://live.gnome.org/GObjectIntrospection/Users">bindings based on GObject Introspection</ulink>.
    </para>

    <para>
     Here is a simple example of a python applet:

     <example>
      <title>Hello World applet, in Python</title>
      <programlisting language="python">
from gi.repository import Gtk
from gi.repository import PanelApplet

def applet_fill(applet):
    label = Gtk.Label("Hello World")
    applet.add(label)
    applet.show_all()

def applet_factory(applet, iid, data):
    if iid != "HelloWorldApplet":
       return False

    applet_fill(applet)

    return True

PanelApplet.Applet.factory_main("HelloWorldFactory",
                                PanelApplet.Applet.__gtype__,

      </programlisting>
     </example>
    </para>

    <para>
     The only limitation of writing an applet in a language other than C is that the applet will not be able to run in the panel process: it will have to stay out-of-process. However, since it is recommended to leave applets out-of-process, this limitation is mitigated.
