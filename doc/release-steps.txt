  The steps for releasing a module is more or less the same for every
module. Below, I've described the steps I take when releasing
gnome-panel, gnome-desktop and gnome-session.

1) Make sure you're up to date: cvs -z3 update -dP

2) Increment the version number in configure.in e.g. bump

<>
    AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE(gnome-panel, 2.3.1)
<>

3) Update the LT_VERSION string if relevant. There's a comment in
   configure.in that explains how this works:

<>
# Before making a release, the LT_VERSION string should be modified.
# The string is of the form C:R:A.
# - If interfaces have been changed or added, but binary compatibility has
#   been preserved, change to C+1:0:A+1
# - If binary compatibility has been broken (eg removed or changed interfaces)
#   change to C+1:0:0
# - If the interface is the same as the previous version, change to C:R+1:A
                                                                                                             
LIB_PANEL_APPLET_LT_VERSION=0:14:0
AC_SUBST(LIB_PANEL_APPLET_LT_VERSION)
<>

    In most cases you won't need to do anything.

4) In the case of gnome-desktop, update:

<>
GNOME_PLATFORM=2
GNOME_MINOR=3
GNOME_MICRO=1
GNOME_VENDOR="Gnome.Org"
GNOME_DATE="14th March, 2003"
<>

   i.e. here I'm doing a release for GNOME 2.3.1 on the 14th of March.

5) Update the version number at the top of the README file.

6) Add an ChangeLog entry e.g.

<>
2003-03-14  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>
                                                                                                             
        * configure.in: Version 2.3.1.
<>

7) Add an entry to the NEWS file. I use a format like

<>
=============
Version 2.3.1
=============

Panel

	* Blah blah blah

Applets

	....

Miscellanous

	....

Translations

	* az(Metin Amiroff), be(Dmitry G. Mastrukov), bg(Alexander Shopov),
	  da(Ole Laursen), eo(JoÃ«l Brich), es(Pablo Gonzalo del Campo),
	  .... and zh_TW(Abel Cheung).
<>

    This is the most time consuming part. First, I do something like:

<>
$ cvs -z3 diff -uNp -r GNOME_PANEL_2_3_0 > changes.txt
<>

   to generate a list of changes since the last release. Then you
   should go through each of the ChangeLogs in the diff and come up
   with a bullet point for each significant change and credit the
   person(s) who did the work. Some tips:

     o If several entries relate to the same change only use a single
       bullet point.
     o Try to make the bullet points short and snappy but
       understandable for a general user. That's not always easy.
     o Generate the list of translations from po/ChangeLog. Note,
       that the actual translator isn't always the one with who added
       the ChangeLog entry - try to credit the right person/team. The
       format is "$locale($translator)". Sort alphabetically by
       locale.

8) Do a autogen && make && make install && make distcheck. Fix any
   issues that crop up. Hopefully there are none because they can be a
   right PITA - especially distcheck errors.

9) While that's churning, compose a mail to
   desktop-devel-list@gnome.org, release-team@gnome.org and
   gnome-announce-list@gnome.org. I use the crappy template below:

<>
http://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2003-March/msg00331.html
<>

   Just copy the NEWS entries in and change the locations on the ftp
   server.

10) Distcheck finishes:

<>
==================================================
gnome-panel-2.3.1.tar.gz is ready for distribution
==================================================
<>

    Yay !

11) Do a cvs commit. If that fails because someone has committed since
    you last updated, then you'll need to repeat the whole thing
    again. Well, update, add a new NEWS entry, and make distcheck
    again.

12) Tag the release. e.g. cvs tag GNOME_PANEL_2_3_1.

13) Add version markers to all ChangeLogs e.g.:

<>
==================== 2.2.2 ====================

2003-05-20 The Little Green Man <greenman@littlepeople.org>

	   * pot-o-gold.c: add ability to theme the pot.
<>

14) Upload the tarball to ftp.gnome.org and install-module the
    tarball. No command-line args are required.

15) Send the mail to the lists.

16) Get yourself a joffee and mutter "I hate doing this fscking crap".
