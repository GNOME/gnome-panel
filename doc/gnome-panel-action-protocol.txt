_GNOME_PANEL_ACTION Protocol

  The _GNOME_PANEL_ACTION is a simple mechanism whereby an
  application window invoke one of a number of simple
  actions which will be handled by the GNOME panel. This
  protocol is intended to be used by window managers who
  provide keybindings for these actions.

  To invoke an action the application sends the following
  ClientMessage to the root window of the screen on which
  the keybinding was activated:

   type = ClientMessage
   window = the root window
   message_type = _GNOME_PANEL_ACTION
   format = 32
   data.l[0] = action
   data.l[1] = timestamp

  Possible action atoms are:

    _GNOME_PANEL_ACTION_MAIN_MENU, ATOM
    _GNOME_PANEL_ACTION_RUN_DIALOG, ATOM
    _GNOME_PANEL_ACTION_KILL_DIALOG, ATOM

  Unsupported actions are ignored by the panel.
