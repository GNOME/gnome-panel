	* panel-widget.c: (bind_top_applet_events): For the
	button-press-event do a g_signal_connect () 
	instead of a g_signal_connect_after ().
	This event was not going through PanelWidget 
	because of which the actual widgets were getting 
	the events. Thus exhibiting strange behaviours.

	  panel-run-dialog.c: don't try and load the glade

==================== 2.5.93 ====================

2004-03-12  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

2004-02-20  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Based on a patch from Bart Martens <info@bartmartens.be>

	* panel-toplevel.c: (panel_toplevel_queue_auto_hide): unqueue
	the unhide, even if the panel is already hidden. The actual
	bug that this fix was for was masked by a change which makes

	Make the change background notification work for applets. Now there is
	one problem left: applets don't keep the new background and come back
	to a plain colour background.
	This fixes bugs #107617, #123092, #107146.
	Some parts of the patch are based on a patch from John Ellis
	<johne@bellatlantic.net>.

	when the background changes.
	(panel_background_init): initialize some new PanelBackground variables
	with the new parameters.

2003-10-20  Vincent Untz  <vincent@vuntz.net>

Wed Sep 17 17:09:22 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel-global.schemas.in: add /apps/panel/global/disabled_applets

	* menu.c, panel-applet-frame.c, panel-profile.[ch]:  Implement the

	  activating.

2003-09-17  Vincent Untz  <vincent@vuntz.net>

	* main.c: don't show the help flags twice in 'gnome-panel --help'.
	Fix bug #107878.

Tue Sep 16 14:22:28 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* applet.c, launcher.c, panel-applet-frame.c, menu.c: In per-panel
	  lockdown mode, do the same thing as the full lockdown, that is,
	  hide the widgets rather then deselect them.  This is both easier
	  and likely more correct.  Insensitive really kind of means that
	  the actions may be possible.  But we want to convey the message
	  that there are no such actions possible.

	* menu.c: catch further instances of possibility of running programs
	  when inhibit command line was on by editing properties of random
	  menu entries.

Tue Sep 16 09:49:01 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* button-widget.c: Fix #121072.  The overlay window was needlessly on
	  the toplevel rather then the button parent (panel-widget) and the
	  geometry may have been messed up.  I made it work precisely like
	  the GtkButton code in this sense (it was half there already
	  actually)

Mon Sep 15 15:05:27 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel-global.schemas.in, panel-toplevel.schemas.in:
	  Add per panel locked_down item and a global locked_down
	  item.

	* applet.c, drawer.c, launcher.c, main.c, menu.c,
	  panel-action-button.c, panel-applet-frame.c,
	  panel-globals.h, panel-menu-bar.c, panel-profile.[ch],
	  panel-run-dialog.c, panel-toplevel.[ch], panel-widget.c,
	  panel.c:  Add toplevel panel locked_down flag and follow
	  it everywhere appropriate and also add a global locked_down
	  flag replacing any remaints of the commie_mode of 1.4.
	  In addition support reading two keys (which don't have
	  schemas yet since this is all kind of tenative and such
	  schemas wouldn't belong to gnome-panel anyway) 
	  /desktop/gnome/lockdown/inhibit_command_line and
	  /desktop/gnome/lockdown/inhibit_force_quit.  Also set
	  the lockdown flag appropriately for external applets so
	  that they can load and behave approperiately.  All this
	  currently requires a panel restart and no effort has been
	  done to support on the fly updating, but I doubt it's
	  worth the extra code baggage.  I suppose this should
	  be followed by some mail to d-d-l about lockdown especially
	  about the "need to be sorted out" bits.

2003-09-12  Arvind Samptur  <arvind.samptur@wipro.com>

	* menu.c (add_drawers_from_dir) : Don't load desktop files
	in the drawer if TryExec fails.

==================== 2.4.0 ====================

==================== 2.3.91 ====================

2003-09-05  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Fixes problem with drawers where they are always open on
	login. Make them closed at login instead.

	* drawer.c: (load_drawer_applet): hide the drawer on startup.
	
	* panel-toplevel.c:
	(panel_toplevel_hide), (panel_toplevel_unhide): show/hide
	drawers when not animating.

2003-09-05  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Patch from George to fix bug #120107 and some other
	stuff.

	* applet.c: (panel_applet_queue_applet_to_load):
	fix leak.
	
	* menu-ditem.c: (get_unique_name): use g_random_int()
	instead of rand().
	
	* panel-util.c: (panel_make_unique_path): ditto.
	
	* panel-profile.c: (panel_profile_load_object): fix leak.
	
	* panel-widget.[ch]:
	(allocate_dirty_child): kill this ugly hack and just resize
	the entire panel when moving an applet.
	(panel_widget_jump_applet_right),
	(panel_widget_switch_applet_right),
	(panel_widget_jump_applet_left), (panel_widget_switch_applet_left),
	(panel_widget_switch_move), (panel_widget_push_applet_right),
	(panel_widget_push_applet_left), (panel_widget_push_move):
	Update all these to resize the entire panel.
	(panel_widget_size_allocate): first normalize the positions
	based on minimum sizes of the applets/objects, basically
	shifting them right such that they need not ever be shifted
	right again. Then allocate sizes to applets (starting from the
	right corner) and finally shift	everything right in case we
	overshot.

2003-09-05  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Schemas to maintain compatibility with the 2.0/2.2
	configurations. 
	
	The problem being addressed here is that because the
	2.0/2.2 panel applies schemas to keys at runtime,
	existing user configurations will end up with
	dangling references to the old schemas unless we
	install these old schemas.
	
	For example, a 2.0/2.2 panel will apply the
	medium/general/panel_id_list schema to
	profiles/default/general/panel_id_list. This
	association is in the user's configuration, not in
	the system GConf database. If the user never changes
	panel_id_list and logs into a machine without this
	schema, then panel_id_list will be empty. 

	* panel-compatibility.schemas: re-add the old
	default config schemas.
	
	* Makefile.am: install the schemas.

==================== 2.3.90 ====================

Thu Aug 28 22:02:41 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel-profile.c: initialize color to black when getting it from
	  gconf fails

Thu Aug 28 10:07:02 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel.c: Fix a leak and be safe in destroying the
	  open_dialogs list.  The destruction of dialogs could
	  perhaps have side effects (though I'm not aware of any)
	  so steal the list so that no one modifies it.

	* panel-applet-frame.c: The open_dialogs are GSList's not
	  GList, so avoid crashes by using the correct function.

Thu Aug 28 08:59:58 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel-util.c: don't free the format if we didn't allocate
	  it in the error dialog code.  Was OKed by the release-team

2003-08-27  Arvind Samptur  <arvind.samptur@wipro.com>

	* panel-widget.[ch] : Re-name create_launcher_dialog_list
	with open_dialogs to reflect a wider range of
	cleanup that we are upto.

	*launcher.c,panel-applet-frame.c,panel.c: Use it

	Fixes the dialogs being left on the screen when 
	the panel is destroyed and the crashes thereafter. #120812

==================== 2.3.7 ====================

Fri Aug 22 14:59:01 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* launcher.c:  after a launcher is created, ensure that the Name,
	  GenericName and Comment fields have a C locale entry (using the
	  current locale one if the user added something).  This should
	  fix #120427, when people create a launcher then log in with
	  different language.

Fri Aug 22 14:28:42 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel-properties-dialog.c: Fix warning when a drawer doesn't
	  have a tooltip set.  Also destroy the dialog when closed
	  (there is absolutely no point in keeping it in memory,
	  that's a waste), and handle closing the dialog with the
	  close WM button without causing crashes/warnings on next
	  use of properties

	* panel-run-dialog.c: When destroying the dialog, destroy
	  the file selection if it exists otherwise closing the
	  dialog without closing the fileselection causes a crash.

Fri Aug 22 09:50:19 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel-applet-frame.c: fix a couple of possible
	  warnings about strings being NULL since the
	  background string can possibly be NULL.  While
	  investigating #120372

	* panel-background.c: the background->desktop can possibly
	  be NULL, so catch that gracefully.  Also add a few
	  preconditions.

Thu Aug 21 13:54:17 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel-compatibility.c: fixing RH #102790, "panel gnomes stole my
	  drawers".  No longer will such gnomes profit from stealing ones
	  drawers.  Issue was that we were setting "toplevel_id" instead
	  of "attached_toplevel_id".  Also the menu setting migration code
	  was migrating main menus into just menus with "applications:"
	  path set.  main_menu=TRUE means use_menu_path must be FALSE.

Thu Aug 21 12:56:48 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel-run-dialog.c: don't complete if the pointer is not on the
	  end of the input, and fix a leak when new prefix is not found.

2003-08-20  Arvind Samptur  <arvind.samptur@wipro.com>

	* panel-background-monitor.c: (panel_background_monitor_setup_pixmap):
	Pass the right type of Atom to gdk_property_get()
	Fixes bug #119898

Tue Aug 19 14:20:17 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel-widget.c: Fixing #120107 where a non-expanded panel would
	  always use the biggest hint of the expaned applets.  Check if
	  allocation didn't give us all the space we needed and compress
	  expanded applets within possibilities.  Don't clamp the upper
	  size of the size request, it is not necessary and in fact
	  just makes trouble since then we wouldn't know how much space
	  we were denied.

Tue Aug 19 13:18:20 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel-toplevel.c: Fix #119984 and RH #102631 by properly
	  calculating the "floating" flag of non-expanded panels.  The
	  floating flag needs to take into account the SNAP_TOLERANCE
	  otherwise it will in fact be wrong.

Mon Aug 18 17:04:39 2003  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.Com>

	* menu.c:  Changed restore_grabs to use a technique similar to
	  drag_end_menu_cb (also in menu.c) to grab the keyboard as
	  well as the pointer.

Wed Aug 13 17:26:20 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel-toplevel.[ch]: Add an accessor to the floating flag,
	  panel_toplevel_get_is_floating

	* panel-profile.c: when creating a new panel, try to find an
	  empty orientation/monitor (free from other non-floating
	  panels).  If no such place is found, will just use the
	  default values.  Fixes #107620

2003-08-13  Christian Neumair  <chris@gnome-de.org>

	* panel-toplevel.c: Localize panel description by adding a few gettext
	calls.

Tue Aug 12 16:34:38 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnome-panel-screenshot.c: convert filenames to utf8 before
	  displaying them in the dialogs.

Tue Aug 12 16:05:34 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* quick-desktop-reader.c: A "fix" for #119623.  If the encoding is
	  set explicitly to UTF-8 ignore the encoding from the language just
	  in case there was any (there isn't supposed to be any!)  This way
	  we read things that were converted wrongly.

Tue Aug 12 12:52:33 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel-struts.c: Allow passing NULL width/height
	  int pointers and just don't update them then

	* panel-toplevel.c:  The update functions want to
	  work with width/height of what it was after
	  the update_size call, so store those values,
	  the strut update function can now update struts
	  based on the final position of animation to get the
	  final position correctly, struts can't really extend
	  beyond screen edges which would make hidden panels
	  whacked out.  The "math" function to compute the
	  "sin" wave is now a much simpler (but almost the
	  same) ninth degree polynomial p(p(x)) where p(x)
	  is a simple cubic.  The animating position is now
	  updated separately short circuiting the position
	  update instead of doing all the position dance as
	  normally.  Fix things in case we ever do animation
	  where we change the width/height which is not currently
	  done.  Don't update the size for hidden panels to avoid
	  completely squishing them and setting them to negative
	  sizes and all such fun.

	  Note: This fixes the struts for panels that hide at
	  least in all the cases which I could find.  Animations
	  are kind of off in some cases, but it would require
	  lots of whacky code to get that right and it's not
	  worth it.  Things it fixes include squishing panels
	  (thus whacking your applet layout), panels not hiding
	  at all, panels animating wrongly, panels jumping around
	  while other panels are hiding and gtk warnings about
	  negative sizes when panels are hidden.  Most of these
	  problems especially for vertical panels being hidden
	  down or up.

Mon Aug 11 11:40:00 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel-toplevel.c: when queing unhide, first check if the panel
	  contains the pointer before whacking the unhide delay, this fixes
	  bugs where panel sometimes would never pop up.

Mon Aug 11 11:22:24 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel-toplevel.c: Fix #119380 by ignoring motion event coming
	  from a different screen then the panel is on.

2003-08-11  Arvind Samptur <arvind.samptur@wipro.com>

	* panel-run-dialog.c: (panel_run_dialog_response): Reset the 
	completion_started flag.
	(event_key): Use the completion_started flag in the right way.  
	Fixes bug #115259

2003-08-11  Padraig O'Briain  <padraig.obriain@sun.com>

	* panel-menu-bar.c (panel_menu_bar_popup_menu): Activate menu bar when
	popping up menu. This fixes bug #118491.

==================== 2.3.6.2 ====================

2003-08-11  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* panel-toplevel.c: (panel_toplevel_update_struts): fix
	syntax error which breaks compile with gcc 2.95.
	Patch from Jens Granseuer in bug #119508.

==================== 2.3.6.1 ====================

2003-08-08  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Fixes multihead breakage in bug #119379.

	* panel-struts.c:
	(panel_struts_allocate_struts): add screen and monitor
	args and only do an allocation run for toplevels on that
	screen/monitor.
	(panel_struts_register_strut),
	(panel_struts_unregister_strut): upd.

2003-08-08  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* panel-struts.[ch]:
	(panel_struts_intersect),
	(panel_struts_allocation_overlapped),
	(panel_struts_allocate_struts),
	(panel_struts_register_strut): keep track of the original
	geometry so that we can apply deltas to the toplevel
	position rather than changing the position explicitly.
	(panel_struts_update_toplevel_geometry): apply the deltas
	here.
	
	* panel-toplevel.c:
	(panel_toplevel_update_position): updating the geometry
	accoring to the struts makes sense in all cases now.
	(panel_toplevel_start_animation): ditto here.

Thu Aug 07 14:34:37 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel-toplevel.c: Fixing bug #115494.  Apparently if some applet
	  opens a menu, we'll never get a leave event.  However we will
	  get focus in/out events, so queue auto hide when those happen.

Thu Aug 07 14:09:56 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel-toplevel.c: don't update struts until we have gotten initial
	  position/size stuff.  Fixes autohide panels from jumping to the
	  other side of the screen on startup.

	* panel-struts.c: correctly position panels in their strut according
	  to the orientation, fixes expanded autohide panels.  All
	  hidden/animating panels are still broken if around other struts.

==================== 2.3.6 ====================

2003-08-07  Arvind Samptur  <arvind.samptur@wipro.com>

	* panel-background.c: (panel_background_set_image):
	Get the panel to upadate to the new image selected
	by the user. Fixes bug #119320

2003-08-07  Frederic Crozat  <fcrozat@mandrakesoft.com>

	* panel-menu-bar.c: (panel_menu_bar_instance_init):
	Use semicolon at end of line, not colon.

2003-08-06  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Patch from Glynn Foster.

	* applet.[ch]:
	(panel_applet_lock): make the remove item insensitive if
	locked.
	(panel_applet_create_menu),
	(panel_applet_register): keep track of the remove item.
	
	* panel-applet-frame.c: (panel_applet_frame_sync_menu_state):
	make the remove item insensitive if locked.

2003-08-06  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* Makefile.am: add panel-struts.[ch].
	
	* panel-struts.[ch]: re-implement some degree of "collision
	avoidance" - i.e. keep panels from overlapping.

	* panel-toplevel.c:
	(panel_toplevel_update_struts): use it here and also fix
	struts on non-rectangular Xinerama.
	(panel_toplevel_update_position), (panel_toplevel_realize),
	(panel_toplevel_finalize), (panel_toplevel_set_auto_hide_size),
	(panel_toplevel_set_auto_hide): use the collision avoidance
	stuff here too.

Tue Aug 05 15:28:14 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* launcher.[ch]: the theme icon stuff is now fixed in gnome-desktop
	  in a slightly nicer way anyway, so revert most of the changes from
	  here.

	* panel-properties-dialog.c: Fixup the code a bit according to mark,
	  and refer to bug #119209 in the code.  Also handle the case where
	  no icon is set at first (in this case normally we also want to
	  theme).

Mon Aug 04 16:52:07 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel-background.c: fix image rotation to be 64bit safe, do
	  rotation for non-alpha images as well, fix for pixbufs with
	  rowstride != width.  Don't do the whole transformation
	  thing unless needed, don't do compositing onto the
	  desktop unless needed.  Fixes really REALLY slow moving if
	  using a background image on non-expanded panels.

	* panel-profile.c: fix the notify for "rotate" key

Fri Aug 01 18:00:51 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	Changes to fix bugs: rh #101304, gnome #116586

	* button-widget.[ch], drawer.c, launcher.c, panel-menu-button.c:
	  The button-widget now can have both stock id and a filename set,
	  using the stock id in case the filename is not found, makes the
	  missing icon logic much simpler and don't need to look up icons
	  everywhere.

	* button-widget.c, drawer.c, launcher.c, panel-menu-button.c:
	  don't resolve the icon names if not needed (and it's not needed
	  for button-widget).  Only lookup the icon in the theme by
	  basename if the icon is not an absolute pathname (or as a backup).

	* panel-properties-dialog.c, launcher.[ch]: When letting the user
	  change the icon resolve the icon name against the current theme,
	  then if the user picked an icon in the same directory as the 
	  resolved icon, assume that we really want the themed icon so only
	  store the basename, otherwise store the full path.

	* panel-profile.c: make sure not to call a gconf set_string with
	  a NULL argument as gconf would complain

	* panel-menu-button.c: fix minor memleak

Fri Aug 01 15:37:02 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel-menu-bar.c: catch and intercept all button_press_events on
	  the two toplevel menus to avoid them going all the way to the
	  menubar.  Fixes #111313 where right clicking on dead space in
	  the menus could bring up confusingly the applet menu.  Very
	  important bugfix indeed, but I think I have a fever, so I'm
	  allowed to fix just simple stuff.

2003-08-01  Arvind Samptur  <arvind.samptur@wipro.com>

	* panel-recent.c: (recent_documents_activate_cb):
	Determine the screen after the widget has been realized
	else you land up with a wrong screen number.
	Fixes bug #118697

	Patch from Leena Gunda (leena.gunda@wipro.com)

2003-07-31  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* panel-menu-button.c: (panel_menu_button_instance_init):
	Add back the tooltip.

2003-07-31  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* panel-menu-button.c: (panel_menu_button_load): re-enable
	that pesky little arrow.

2003-07-31  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Evil duplication of effort happening here. This reverts George's
	fix for #117710 (add entire menu as drawer) and uses a nicer fix
	I happened to be working on at the same time. No, I'm not a nice
	person.

	* drawer.[ch]:
	(panel_drawer_prepare): split out from panel_drawer_create()
	and allow preparing the attached toplevel before loading.
	(panel_drawer_create): upd.
	(panel_drawer_create_with_id): impl loading onto a toplevel
	with only the toplevels id.
	
	* launcher.[ch]:
	(panel_launcher_create_with_id): allow loading onto a toplevel
	with only its id.
	(panel_launcher_create): use with_id().
	
	* menu.c:
	(vfs_text_uri_exists): impl.
	(add_drawers_from_dir),
	(add_menudrawer_to_panel): re-implement to allow prepare the
	drawer, launchers and all sub-drawers and then load them all
	in one go.
	
	* panel.c: (drop_internal_applet): upd.
	
	* applet.c: (panel_applet_register): g_strdup is NULL tolerant.

2003-07-31  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* panel-profile.[ch]: (panel_profile_create_toplevel):
	Add a GdkScreen * argument and create the toplevel on
	that screen.
	
	* menu.c: (create_new_panel): create the toplevel on
	the correct screen.

Wed Jul 30 16:58:56 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* launcher.c: fix #117130.  When icon is empty pass ""
	  as the icon.  This will force the button-widget code to
	  load the missing icon.

Wed Jul 30 15:14:20 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel-widget.h, panel-toplevel.[ch]: make the get_panel_widget
	  method typesafe by including the PanelWidget typedef in the
	  header unless it has been typedeffed before.

	* menu.c, drawer.c, applet.c, panel.c: fix the add drawers from
	  menu thingie which should fix #117710 (all the other things
	  seem fixed already).

Wed Jul 30 12:50:28 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel-util.c: in bug #117877 we saw 'foo' displayed since that
	  was the temporary text in the error dialog before the real
	  text was set.  Change that to be more meaningful (even though
	  not translated, since it's a really bad bug if it ever happens)

	* panel-menu-button.c: Don't ref/sink the menu when we make it,
	  since we attach it to the button the button will own a ref.
	  Also don't just unref to kill the menu, detach it, that will
	  take care of the reference as well.  Also disconnect the
	  signal handler in the detacher just in case something held
	  onto a reference of the menu somewhere.

	* panel-toplevel.c: Fixing bug #118368, where a vertical panel
	  that was floating (or stuck to the right side) and wasn't
	  expanded would gradually move to the top/left corner on
	  each restart.  Add geometry_updated_initial flag to the
	  private structure and don't do the position_centered
	  stuff if geometry was not yet updated since we're still
	  just setting initial values.

Tue Jul 29 18:27:48 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* button-widget.c, launcher.c, menu.c, menu-ditem.c, panel-action-button.c,
	  panel-recent.c, panel-run-dialog.c, panel-shell.c, panel-util.c:
	  Fixed crashes on two panel_error_dialog invocations that weren't
	  quite converted.  Also never NEVER use an error message we got
	  from somewhere else as a format, that way lie crashes and security
	  problems.

2003-07-24  Alex Duggan  <aldug@astrolinux.com>

	* panel-toplevel.schemas.in: s/indentify/identify/
	Fixes #117993

==================== 2.3.4.1 ====================

2003-07-24  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Remove visible mnemonics from the Actions menu and Add to Panel
	menus. Based on patch from Glynn.

	* menu-util.[ch]: (stock_menu_item_new): huh ? Why on earth
	is there a function that looks like setup_stock_menu_item,
	but isn't. Dammit, we don't need code duplication.
	
	* menu.[ch]:
	(applet_menu_append), (applet_menu_append_category),
	(make_add_submenu): remove visible mnemonics.
	(setup_stock_menu_item): make public

	* panel-menu-bar.c:
	(panel_menu_bar_append_action_item): use setup_stock_menu_item().
	(panel_menu_bar_append_actions_menu): remove visible mnemonics.
	
	* panel-recent.c:
	(panel_recent_append_documents_menu): use setup_stock_menu_item()
	and remove the visible mnemonic.

2003-07-24  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Fix problem where the context menu for the menu bar pops
	up in the wrong place. Based on a patch from Glynn in
	bug #111313.

	* menu-util.c: (panel_position_applet_menu): only position
	the menu relative to the panel for NO_WINDOW widgets.

	(panel_menu_bar_parent_set): replace stupid warning with
	an assertion.
	
2003-07-24  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Fixes weirdness where sometimes the drawer panel, when
	it is hidden, is above the drawer button.
	
	* panel-toplevel.c:
	(panel_toplevel_update_animating_position): unmap the
	attached toplevel at the end of the animation.
	(panel_toplevel_start_animation): re-map it here before
	starting the animation.
	(panel_toplevel_hide): move raising the parent toplevel
	to just after re-mapping the attached toplevel.

2003-07-24  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Fixes drawers getting destroyed when you create
	a new panel.
	
	* panel-profile.c:
	(panel_profile_load_added_ids): s/toplevel_id/id/
	(panel_profile_toplevel_id_list_notify): don't pass 
	attached toplevels as being part of the existing
	toplevel_id_list.
	
2003-07-24  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* button-widget.c:
	(button_widget_set_orientation): force a re-scale of the button.
	Fixes rectangular buttons not re-scaling on vertical panels.
	
2003-07-24  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Fix launchers and action buttons not re-sizing when you move
	them onto a vertical panel.
	
	* panel.c: (orientation_change): change the orientation
	on launchers and action buttons too.

	* drawer.[ch]: (panel_drawer_use_custom_icon_changed),
	(panel_drawer_custom_icon_changed): upd.
	(set_drawer_applet_orientation): kill.
	
	* panel-menu-button.[ch]:

	(button_widget_set_has_arrow), (button_widget_get_has_arrow),
	(button_widget_set_dnd_highlight),
	(button_widget_get_dnd_highlight): re-implement properties for
	ButtonWidget to make it much more sane. Say bye-bye to cruft
	like button_widget_change_params().
	
2003-07-23  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Implement a properties dialog for drawers based on the
	standard panel properties dialog. Fixes bug #107606.

2003-07-22  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Remove auto-hiding into the corner again. It seems the
	only people who like it are people who don't use
	autohide panels :-) The main fault with it seems to
	be that you have to do a lot of tricky manoevouring
	to put you mouse into the corner and then bring it
	back to whatever you wanted on the panel. See #81843.

	* panel-toplevel.c:
	(panel_toplevel_update_struts): fix struts weirdness
	with autohide panels.
	(panel_toplevel_update_auto_hide_position): don't
	hide into corners any more.
	(panel_toplevel_start_animation): hmm,
	MAX (func (x), func (y)) isn't very efficient is it
	now ? Also, don't take into account the end width and
	height when they are -1 - fixes slowness in hiding.
	(panel_toplevel_enter_notify_event),
	(panel_toplevel_leave_notify_event),
	(panel_toplevel_instance_init): kill code to figure out
	which corner to hide to based on the last leave notify.

2003-07-22  Arvind Samptur  <arvind.samptur@wipro.com>

	* panel-run-dialog.c : Get rid of panel_run_dialog_free() 
	as it is not adding any value.  Fixes crash #114799

2003-07-21  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* panel-menu-button.c: (panel_menu_button_create): fix typo

	* main.c, menu-util.[ch], menu.[ch], panel-globals.h, panel-menu-bar.c,
	  panel-stock-icons.[ch]:  whack the KDE menus.  These are the old
	  style menus anyway and KDE menus should be merged by the vfolder
	  stuff anyway.

Wed Jul 16 10:01:21 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel-stock-icons.c: if the stock icon is "go" and we don't find
	  it, don't warn.  This is a KDE icon, so it is normal that it is
	  not installed.  And if KDE is not installed we won't have the
	  KDE menu anyway so it won't be used either.  Just ignore this
	  just like we ignore PANEL_STOCK_ACTION now.

2003-07-16  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* panel-stock-icons.c:
	* panel-stock-icons.h: remove PANEL_STOCK_ARROW definitions.
	Fixes "panel-stock-arrow-right" not found warnings.

2003-07-15  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* panel-applet-frame.c:
	(panel_applet_frame_construct): no need to ref the connection
	here. Removes dependancy on ORBit 2.7.x.

==================== 2.3.4 ====================

2003-07-15  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Make the items in the Main Menu have invisible mnemonics too.
	Fixes bug #117457.

	* menu.[ch]:
	(setup_full_menuitem): add an extra "invisible_mnemonic"
	arg and if true make the first character of the menu item
	a hidden accelerator.
	(create_root_menu): use it here for the Main Menu.

	* applet.c: upd.

Mon Jul 14 10:22:39 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel-properties-dialog.(c|glade): Add warning label if some of the
	  properties are locked down so that the user isn't just baffled that
	  they are insensitive, also change the g_asserts that I added into
	  g_return_if_fails which are less anal

	* applet.c: if say the background property is not locked down, the
	  panel_right_stick and position properties of an applet can still
	  change, so check for writability of those before writing them

2003-07-14  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* panel-applet-frame.c: (panel_applet_frame_change_size):
	normalise the applet size to the values defined in the
	IDL so we don't break some applets. What a mess.
	
	* panel-util.h: remove the G_GNUC_PRINTF stuff for 
	panel_error_dialog since we've obfuscated the function
	enough now that the compiler can't have a hope of
	knowing what we're at.

2003-07-14  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* panel-run-dialog.c:
	(set_window_icon_from_stock): impl.
	(panel_run_dialog_set_icon),
	(panel_run_dialog_setup_pixmap): use PANEL_STOCK_RUN
	instead of GTK_STOCK_EXECUTE.
	(panel_run_dialog_new): set the window icon appropriately.
	
	* panel-run-dialog.glade: don't set the stock icon here.

2003-07-13  Christian Neumair  <chris@gnome-de.org>

	* panel-toplevel.schemas.in: Third and hopefully last string adaption.
	Menthos rocks.

2003-07-12  Christian Neumair  <chris@gnome-de.org>

	* panel-toplevel.schemas.in: Fixed string I borked during the last
	cleanup round (#116897).

	* menu-ditem.c: My last patch (#113433) destroyed a string semantically.
	Fix this.

2003-07-11  Christian Neumair  <chris@gnome-de.org>

	* launcher.c:
	* menu-ditem.c:
	* menu.c:
	* panel-action-button.c:
	* panel-recent.c:
	* panel-run-dialog.c:
	* panel-util.[ch]: (panel_error_dialog): Revamp error dialog
	construction. Now we have a primary and a secondary format message and
	set the appropriate pango attributes (#113433).

2003-07-11  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* panel-stock-icons.h: change the default icon
	size to 24x24. See bug #114920.

2003-07-08  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Modified version of excellant patch from
	Rob Adams <robadams@ucla.edu> in bug #116025.

	* panel-xutils.[ch]: (panel_xutils_set_strut): support
	new EWMH hint _NET_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL.

	* panel-multiscreen.[ch]:
	(panel_multiscreen_is_at_visible_extreme): new function
	determines whether a given monitor is along the visible
	edge of the logical screen.
	
	* panel-toplevel.c (panel_toplevel_update_struts):
	support new panel_xutils_set_strut().
	(panel_toplevel_get_monitor_geometry): Change function to
	also get origin of monitor so we can do a more accurate
	heuristic for "on the edge"

2003-07-09  Christian Neumair  <chris@gnome-de.org>

	* panel-general.schemas.in:
	* panel-object.schemas.in:
	* panel-toplevel.schemas.in: Fixed scattered typo bugs filed by
	Christian Rose: #116878, #116883, #116884, 116897, #116899, #116924.

Tue Jul 08 16:44:02 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel-applet-frame.c: Handle more errors in the constructor.  Still
	  ORBit/Bonobo is broken and crashes, I have a workaround in mind if,
	  they don't get fixed.  When the applet whacks out during the
	  construct we now handle it in the same way as if we can't activate
	  the applet with a gui dialog.  Don't connect to the broken signal
	  until we're all done with init.

	* panel-widget.c: detach attached toplevel on remove and attach it on
	  add.  Fixes moving of drawers from one panel to another.

Tue Jul 08 10:35:41 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* menu.c: when hierarchy changed, remove old mnemonic before adding
	  it to the new window avoids warning on exit and likely bad
	  behaviour when reparenting things.

	* panel-applet-frame.c: avoid crash/warning by only checking the
	  locked flag while the widget and info structure still exists,
	  for the reload-if-applet-crashes code.

Tue Jul 08 09:50:24 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel-gconf.c: when cleaning a directory don't clean keys we can't
	  write

2003-07-07  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* gnome-panel-screenshot.schemas.in:
	* panel-general.schemas.in:
	* panel-global.schemas.in:
	* panel-object.schemas.in:
	* panel-toplevel.schemas.in: much work on keys
	documentation to make it more consitent, fix
	typos and use correct terminology. Patch from
	Christian Neumair in bug #112527.

2003-07-07  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Add mnemonics to the Applications, Actions and "Add to Panel"
	menus, but make the ones in Applications invisible. Based 
	on a patch from Muktha in bug #72008.
	
	* menu.c:
	(setup_mnemonic), (setup_invisible_mnemonic): implement
	setting a mnemonic for a menu item without actually
	underlining the appropriate character.
	(create_menuitem): set an invisible mnemonic.
	(applet_menu_append), (applet_menu_append_category),
	(make_add_submenu): use visible mnemonics here.
	
	* menu-util.c: (stock_menu_item_new): allow mnemonics.
	
	* panel-menu-bar.c: (panel_menu_bar_append_actions_menu):
	add mnemonics to the Actions menu.
	
	* panel-recent.c: (panel_recent_append_documents_menu):
	add mnemonic.
	
2003-07-07  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Pre-load some directories that weren't previously being
	loaded. Should improve startup time significantly.
	
	* panel-profile.c:
	(panel_profile_load_toplevel): preload the background
	directory explicitly. Recursive preloading never worked.
	(panel_profile_load_object): preload the applet's
	directories too.

2003-07-05  Dennis Cranston <dennis_cranston at yahoo com>

	* menu-ditem.c: (panel_new_launcher)  Adjust padding of 
	the 'Create Launcher' dialog used by nautilus.  This 
	should cover all the launcher dialogs.
	
2003-07-05  Dennis Cranston <dennis_cranston at yahoo com>

	* menu-ditem.c: (panel_edit_dentry, panel_edit_direntry)  
	Adjust padding of two more 'Launcher Properties' dialogs.

2003-07-03  Rajkumar Sivasamy  <rajkumar.siva@wipro.com>

	* button-widget.c: Make panel-buttons that use stock icons 
	to respect theme changes.
	Fixes bug: 116452

2003-07-03  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>
	
	* menu.[ch]:
	(panel_create_menu): rename from panel_menu_new().
	(menu_new): upd.

	* applet.c: (setup_an_item), (add_to_submenus),
	(panel_applet_create_menu):
	* panel-menu-bar.c: (panel_menu_bar_append_actions_menu):
	* panel-recent.c: (panel_recent_append_documents_menu):
	update.

	* panel-frame.c: fix comment.

Wed Jul 02 16:08:23 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel-widget.c: when panel is destroyed make sure that the
	  master's widget associated key is wiped so that we don't
	  try to access freed data and crash (fixes crash and/or warning
	  on exit when drawers are present)

	* drawer.c: when our toplevel is destroyed, set the
	  toplevel member to NULL and whack the button.  Fixes
	  crash and/or warning on exit when drawers are present.

Wed Jul 02 11:43:26 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel-applet-frame.c: when creating new applets be more careful
	  about errors and null returns if they can possibly happen, and
	  fix a leak when this happens

	* panel-widget.c: the time on events with send_event (hand generated
	  events) seems to be bogus for the drag start and so just
	  use GDK_CURRENT_TIME in this case.  This fixes dragging applets
	  like fish and window-list for me.

2003-07-02  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>
	
	* panel-stock-icons.[ch]: add a new stock id "panel-main-menu"
	pointing to the gnome-main-menu icon to allow the main menu
	icon to be themed seperately from the GNOME logo.

	* menu.c: (make_add_submenu):
	* panel-menu-button.c: (panel_menu_button_instance_init),
	(panel_menu_button_set_icon), (panel_menu_button_set_dnd_enabled):
	Use PANEL_STOCK_MAIN_MENU.

==================== 2.3.3.3 ====================

2003-07-02  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Patch from Daniel Baeyens in bug #114603.

	* panel-toplevel.schemas.in: consistently use "three" instead
	of "3".

2003-07-02  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Patch from Fernando Herrera in bug #115572.

	* gnome-panel-screenshot.c: (take_window_shot): fix problem
	with taking a window screenshot when the window is overlapped
	by showing the window before taking the shot.

2003-07-02  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Patch from Christophe Fergeau in bug #113238.

	* gnome-desktop-item-edit.c:
	* menu-ditem.c:
	* menu-fentry.c:
	* panel-util.c: remove unnecessary gnome-vfs includes.

2003-07-02  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Based on patch from Kaushal Kumar in bug #114565.

	* panel-shell.c: (panel_shell_register): register the
	panel shell as per display, not per screen.

2003-07-02  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	 Based on patch from Mark Finlay in bug #114056.

	* menu.c: (show_about_dialog): make the about dialog much more
	sane (or boring from George's POV :-). no "End World Hunger"
	link, no picture of a goat, no talk about random X crashes,
	no Monty Python reference and make the credits list alphabetically
	sorted.

2003-07-02  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* applet.c: make panel_applet_have_load_idle static.
	
2003-07-01  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Fix bug #109374. When no panel's are found in the default
	configuration, show a fallback panel so we don't end up
	with a running panel process and no panels.

	This seems to be getting reported a fair bit, so I reckon
	packagers mustn't yet have twigged about installing the
	default configuration using gconftool-2 --load. Your post
	install magic should be something like this:

	gconftool-2 --direct
	            --config-source=$GCONF_CONFIG_SOURCE
	            --load %{_sysconfdir}/gconf/schemas/panel-default-setup.entries

	* panel-profile.c:
	(panel_profile_find_new_id): assert that we always return
	an id.
	(panel_profile_copy_defaults_for_screen): fix using the
	wrong key for the schemas location.
	(panel_profile_create_fallback_toplevel_list): impl returning
	a list of fallback toplevels. Currently just a single toplevel
	according to the schemas defaults with no objects.
	(panel_profile_load_defaults_on_screen): if we can't find any
	toplevels in the default configuration, load a fallback panel.
	(panel_profile_ensure_toplevel_per_screen): kill FIXME.
	
2003-07-01  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Fix issue with drawer panels not getting deleted when
	you delete the drawer button.

	* drawer.[ch]:
	(destroy_drawer): actually destroy the toplevel instead
	of just detaching it.
	(panel_drawer_delete): kill.

	* applet.c:
	(panel_applet_clean): don't call panel_drawer_delete().
	
Tue Jul 01 16:54:53 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel-applet-frame.c: only delete the applet from config (when we
	  can't load) if we can actually write to the applets list

Tue Jul 01 16:00:06 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* applet.[ch], panel-profile.c: kill reentrancy issues on the
	  applet loading idle.  When we get a notify for new applets to load,
	  don't add the ones already on the load queue.  This should fix
	  issues when dealing with applets that don't want to load for
	  some reason.

2003-07-01  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Fix location of arrow on non-rectangular menu buttons and
	fix problem where you can't make the panel smaller because
	launchers etc. refuse to get smaller.

	* button-widget.c:
	(draw_arrow), (button_widget_expose): redo the calculation
	of arrow co-ordinates to not assume the icon is square.
	
	* panel-widget.[ch]:
	(panel_widget_size_request): if an applet has its size
	constrained don't increase the panel's requisition if the
	applet's requisition is larger.
	(panel_widget_add): initialize size_constrained.
	(panel_widget_set_applet_size_constrained): add per-applet
	flag to specify whether the panel should expand when an
	applet is larger than the panel.
	
	* panel-applet-frame.c:
	(panel_applet_frame_load): set size_constrained.
	(panel_applet_frame_size_constrain),
	(panel_applet_frame_size_request): don't constrain the
	applet's size here.
	
	* drawer.c: (load_drawer_applet):
	* launcher.c: (load_launcher_applet):
	* panel-action-button.c: (panel_action_button_load):
	* panel-menu-button.c: (panel_menu_button_load): set
	size_constrained.

==================== 2.3.3.2 ====================

2003-07-01  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* panel-default-setup.entries: make the default panel's
	be 32 pixels wide instead of 24. Turns out we were
	unwittingly adding an extra 6 pixels before anyway so ...

2003-07-01  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* button-widget.[ch]:
	(button_widget_load_pixbuf_and_scale),
	(button_widget_reload_pixbuf), (button_widget_expose),
	(button_widget_size_request), (button_widget_size_allocate),
	(button_widget_instance_init): allow rectangular buttons and
	make the button fully occupy the panel height.
	
	* panel-frame.c: (panel_frame_size_request): only request
	room to draw bevels for the edges on which we are actually
	going to draw the bevels.
	
	* panel-toplevel.c:
	(panel_toplevel_update_size): only request room to draw bevels
	for the edges on which we are actually going to draw the bevels.
	(panel_toplevel_size_request): don't chain up to GtkWindow's
	size_request, just ask the child for its requisition.
	
	* drawer.c: (load_drawer_applet):
	* launcher.c: (load_launcher_applet):
	* panel-menu-button.c: (panel_menu_button_load):
	* panel-action-button.c: (panel_action_button_load): set the
	expand_minor flag.

2003-07-01  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* button-widget.[ch]: remove the size property and args to
	the constructors. We weren't using it anywhere.

	* drawer.c: (create_drawer_applet):
	* launcher.c: (create_launcher): upd.

2003-07-01  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* panel-applet-frame.c: (panel_applet_frame_event_listener):
	kill debug spew.

Mon Jun 30 14:56:23 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel-profile.[ch], panel-run-dialog.c: if we can't set the
	  show_program_list thing, make the checkbox insensitive

Mon Jun 30 14:17:22 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* menu.c: only setup internal dragging of applets/objects if the
	  relevant gconf lists are actually writable.

	* panel.c: on drop check if we can actually do the action requested,
	  and if not run the gdk_drag_finish with FALSE for success.  It
	  would be nicer to just not allow the drop in the first place but
	  this would likely have a performance hit unless we did lots of
	  work on caching the writability info which is probably an overkill.

Mon Jun 30 11:25:29 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* applet.[ch], panel-applet-frame.c: add
	  panel_applet_can_move_freely and panel_applet_lockable, which
	  tests the writability of the keys needed for such actions.
	  The bonobo applets now make use of this and the objects now
	  also grey out respective menuitems.

	* panel-widget.c: Check for freely being movable before starting
	  a move.  (act as locked if we can't write any of the keys, needed
	  for moving)

	* menu.c: the menu rightclick options now respect key-writability

	* launcher.[ch]: When we can't hoard a launcher (when the location
	  key is non-writable), make the whole entry non-writable.  Doesn't
	  affect already hoarded launchers, but if you set the location to
	  somewhere else and make it mandatory, that prevents the properties
	  from coming up (since we couldn't edit it anyway).

	* panel-util.c: in the help showing code there was some error
	  badness.  Now only show the first error set if nothing succeeded,
	  as not to have GError complain, and also clear error if a 
	  failover succeeded.

2003-06-30  Padraig O'Briain  <padraig.obriain@sun.com>

	* menu.c (panel_make_sure_menu_within_screen): Omit call to
        our_gtk_menu_position as it is being called twice.

Fri Jun 27 17:19:04 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* applet.c: (panel_applet_save_position) Only set things which are
	  different.  This helps out if some of these are not writable,
	  and some are.  Though we should have a dirty flag to handle this.

	* menu.c, panel-profile.[ch]:  Add panel_profile_list_is_writable
	  to check writability of one of the lists, When the applets and
	  the object lists are not writable don't allow removing or adding
	  of things.

	* panel-applet-frame.c: for bonobo applets check the keys
	  related to moving/removing/locking and disable those commands
	  if those are not possible.  When applet dies and the user
	  wants to not-reload it, but we can't write to the applets
	  list, don't remove it, but don't reload it either.

	* panel-toplevel.c, panel-profile.[ch]: add
	  panel_profile_can_be_moved_freely which checks a bunch of
	  keys for a toplevel to be able to move with the cursor.
	  We could do this more finegrained, but for now this should
	  at least work right without gconf errors from mandatory
	  settings.

Fri Jun 27 12:47:58 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel-toplevel.c: if orientation is not writable, then don't allow
	  moving as that would change orientation, same with size and
	  resizing.  So panels themselves should now be pretty much
	  lockdownable by mandatory settings.

Fri Jun 27 12:11:30 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel-profile.[ch], panel-properties-dialog.(c|glade):  Finish
	  "key-writability", that is, if keys are not writable, then don't
	  let the gui elements that change those keys be sensitive.

Thu Jun 26 18:43:38 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel-profile.[ch], panel-properties-dialog.c: key-writability
	  changes for a few toggles.  I think I got the properties setup of
	  panel figured out now.

Thu Jun 26 11:17:59 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnome-panel-preferences.c: When keys become non-writable (when this
	  changes), then also (de)sensitize things.  And listen for the lock-down
	  key changes (this key should be renamed and mentioned in a scheme
	  I would say)

	* gnome-panel-preferences.c: If we can't load the .glade file, exit
	  after displaying the error instead of crashing.

Wed Jun 25 17:09:09 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnome-panel-preferences.c: when a key is not writable make that gui
	  element insensitive.  Also don't compare bools with a '=' since
	  that may not always work, so be anal and do the right thing.

2003-06-24  Rajkumar Sivasamy  <rajkumar.siva@wipro.com>

	* button-widget.c: Draw button-widget focus line with
	state GTK_STATE_NORMAL.
	Fixes Bug: 109887	

2003-06-23  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Fix #114962 by delaying reading the size hints and flags
	properties and by monitoring for changes on the property
	bag. Also remove the many synchronous reads on the property
	bag, which should speed up startup.

	* panel-applet-frame.c:
	(panel_applet_frame_set_flags_from_any),
	(panel_applet_frame_set_size_hints_from_any),
	(panel_applet_frame_init_properties): impl reading the
	properties and setting them on the PanelWidget.
	(panel_applet_frame_load): read the properties after
	adding to the PanelWidget.
	(panel_applet_frame_get_flags),
	(panel_applet_frame_update_expand_flags),
	(panel_applet_frame_get_size_hints): kill.
	(panel_applet_frame_change_orientation),
	(panel_applet_frame_change_size),
	(panel_applet_frame_change_background): use macros for
	property names.
	(panel_applet_frame_paint): don't do a sync read on
	the property.
	(panel_applet_frame_constrain_size): don't update the
	expand flags.
	(panel_applet_frame_size_request),
	(panel_applet_frame_size_allocate),
	(panel_applet_frame_button_changed): no more sync reads.
	(panel_applet_frame_instance_init),
	(panel_applet_frame_event_listener),
	(panel_applet_frame_construct): monitor for changes on
	properties.
	
	* panel-widget.[ch]:
	(panel_widget_size_request): don't read the size hints
	here.
	(panel_widget_set_applet_expandable): nomalize the bools.
	(panel_widget_set_applet_size_hints): implement.
	
2003-06-19  Dennis Cranston <dennis_cranston at yahoo com>

	* launcher.c: (ask_about_launcher)  Adjust padding

2003-04-10  Dennis Cranston <dennis_cranston at yahoo.com>

	* gnome-run.c:  UI review changes for bug #98908.
	  - application description should be left aligned
	  - s/Append File.../Run with File...
	  - the entry at the top changes its dimension when the
	    icon dimension changes.
	  - s/Run Program.../Run Application...
	   
	* menu.c, panel-action-button.c, panel-general.schemas.in,
	  panel-menu-bar.c:  UI review changes for bug #98908.

	when applets are added. Fixes panel unhiding on login,
	bug #109604.

2003-04-09  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Update the sensitivity of the image/color configuration
	widgets as appropriate to the selected background type.
	Fixes #107609.

	* panel-properties-dialog.c:
	(panel_properties_dialog_upd_sensitivity): impl. making
	the color/image configuration widgets insentive as
	appropriate.
	(panel_properties_dialog_background_toggled),
	(panel_properties_dialog_setup_background_radios),
	(panel_properties_dialog_update_background_type): use it.
	Also remove all references to the transparency radio
	button. It doesn't exist anymore.

	* panel-properties-dialog.glade: name the containers of
	the image/color widgets sensibly so we can get a handle
	to them.

2003-04-09  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* panel.c: (panel_key_press_event): only activate the
	binding if its Ctrl-F10. Fixes #109791, Shift-F10 was
	popping up the panel's context menu not the applet's
	menu.

2003-04-08  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* panel-properties-dialog.glade: Commit patch from
	Luca Ferretti <elle.uca@libero.it> to make things a

	file has been appended using Append File. Fixes #86610.

	* drawer.c (key_press_drawer): Make left and right arrow keys move
	focus from drawer in horizontal panel to next item in panel. Up and
	down arrow keys move focus from open drawer into the drawer and have
	no effect for closed drawer. Similar behavior for vertical panels.
	Fixes bug #99176.

2003-04-01  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Fix long standing bug where size changes affected applet
	positions. E.g. make the panel bigger then smaller and
	there used to be gaps between all your launchers, changing
	the font size used to move the clock applet, adding an
	icon to the notification area and then removing it caused
	it to change position etc.

	* panel-widget.h: add another member to AppletData
	which tracks the actual position as it currently
	appears on the panel. AppletData:pos now corresponds
	to the user specified position as opposed to the
	constrained position.

	* panel-widget.c:
	(emit_applet_moved): impl.
	(panel_widget_cremove): fixup.
	(panel_widget_is_applet_stuck): re-write for clarity.
	(get_size_from_hints): respect the min_cells hint here.

	and don't do any actual moving.
	(panel_widget_switch_applet_right),
	(panel_widget_switch_applet_left),
	(panel_widget_get_right_switch_pos),
	(panel_widget_get_left_switch_pos), (panel_widget_switch_move),
	(push_applet_right), (push_applet_left), (panel_widget_push_move),
	(panel_widget_right_stick): use the constrained position when
	figuring out where to move things and emit the moved signal at
	when applets have been moved.
	(panel_widget_size_allocate): don't make size changes affect
	the user specified position. Also don't saze the constrained
	position.
	(panel_widget_applet_drag_start_no_grab), (walk_up_to),
	(is_in_applet), (panel_widget_get_free_spot): upd. to use the
	constrained position as appropriate.
	(panel_widget_nice_move): emit the moved signal.
	(panel_widget_applet_move_to_cursor),
	(panel_widget_add): use the constrained positionl.
	(panel_widget_reparent): emit the moved signal.

	of the button_press_event to the Menu Bar applet.
	(create_menuitem) : Use menu_dummy_button_press_event().

	* panel-menu-bar.c : (panel_menu_bar_append_action_item) :
	* panel-recent.c : (panel_recent_append_documents_menu) :
	Use menu_dummy_button_press_event().

	Fixes bug #107737

2003-03-14  Matthias Clasen  <maclas@gmx.de>

	* main.c (main): Move session registration after profile loading
	to avoid setting an incomplete restart command.

2003-03-11  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* panel-background.c: (background_changed): don't unref
	the desktop pixbuf if its NULL. Might fix bug #108062.

2003-03-10  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* panel-profile.c:
	(panel_profile_load_added_ids):
	(panel_profile_delete_removed_ids): both of these
	should return void. Thanks to Arvind for pointing
	it out.

2003-03-10  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* button-widget.c:
	(button_widget_theme_changed): reload the icon when the
	icon theme changes.
	(load_pixbuf), split out from button_load_pixbuf().
	(button_load_pixbuf): try loading with the icon basename
	first and if that fails use the full path. This will ensure
	that launchers with absolute paths for icons will theme
	correctly, #106649.
	(button_widget_instance_init): connect to the icon theme's
	'changed' signal.

	* launcher.[ch]: (free_launcher), (setup_button): remove handling
	the icon theme's "changed" signal here.

2003-03-07  Arvind Samptur <arvind.samptur@wipro.com>
	* panel-toplevel.c : (panel_toplevel_realize) : Remove the
	panel window from the window group. Else the WM will stack
	all the child windows of the panel above all apps.

	* xstuff.c : (xstuff_set_no_group) Remove the part 
	of disabling input.

	* panel-properties-dialog.c : (panel_properties_dialog_new):

	Fixes #107616

2003-03-07  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Fix #107775 - panel "forgets" it on the top and goes back
	to the bottom.

	* panel-toplevel.c: (panel_toplevel_update_expanded_position):
	Set toplevel->priv->x/y to the location the panel should be
	in when not hidden. These co-ordinates are not transient
	location of the panel.

2003-03-07  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* panel-profile.c: (panel_profile_add_to_list): fix bug with
	"New Panel". Another bug caused by my stupid "sprintf to
	static buffer" function.

2003-03-06  Arvind Samptur <arvind.samptur@wipro.com>
	* panel-properties-dialog.c : 
	(panel_properties_dialog_update_background_opacity) : When 
	recalculating the percentage, cast it to double. Else you always
	land up with one value less because of integer division and 
	that spins off the continuous scale setting. Fixes #107608
	Thanks to Satyajit for fighting this one.

2003-03-06  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* menu.c: (Bonobo_ServerInfoList_equals), (recheck_applet_list):
	re-enable the re-loading of the applet menu. It crashes for
	some people but we need to fix that.

2003-03-06  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* gnome-run.c: (find_icon_timeout), (add_icon_idle),

2003-03-05  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

2003-03-04  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Don't include drawer toplevels in the toplevel_id_list

	(panel_compatibility_migrate_panel_id_list): retain a map

2003-02-27  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* Makefile.am: kill global-keys.[ch]

	* throughout: use panel_gconf_get_client() - gconf_client_get_default

2003-02-06  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* Makefile.am: add panel-bindings.[ch].

	* panel-bindings.[ch]: read and monitor metacity's
	window binding preferences to use for keybindings

	(panel_toplevel_toggle_expand), (panel_toplevel_expand),
	(panel_toplevel_unexpand), (panel_toplevel_toggle_hidden),

	Make drawers work more or less and implement resizing the

	* button-widget.c: (draw_arrow): hmm, I think the semantics

	is probably more.

	* drawer.c:

	(set_drawer_applet_orientation): don't set the toplevel
	orienation.

	(panel_widget_setup): don't connect to the PanelWidget orientation
	change signal - that only notifies of changes between horiz/vert.
	(panel_setup): connect to notify::orientation on the toplevel
	instead.

2003-01-29  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Replace BasePWidget and co. with a single widget written
	from scratch. Basically, this means there are is no
	such thing as panel types any more - you can easily
	swicth between what was an edge panel to what was a
	corner/floating/sliding panel. Switching between corner/
	floating/sliding is just a matter of moving the panel.

	Some other improvements in the widget like auto hiding
	into corners, stock gtk arrows for the hide buttons,
	no shadow at the screen edge, simpler (and hopefully
	smoother) animations.

	This patch isn't finished. Loading/saving Configuration
	doesn't work, drawers don't work (implemented but crashing),
	propert keynav for the widget has to be implemented etc.
	See the TODO in panel-toplevel.c

	* Makefile.am: remove loads of files, add a good few
	files. Generate enums from panel-enums.h. Only ever
	generate enum types, not flags types.

	* aligned-widget.[ch], basep-widget.[ch], border-widget.[ch],
	  drawer-widget.[ch], edge-widget.[ch], floating-widget.[ch],
	  sliding-widget.[ch]: remove these.

	* panel-toplevel.[ch]: add a new toplevel panel widget.
	A complete rewrite BasePWidget and co., and consolidates
	them all into a single widget.

	* panel-frame.[ch]: new widget which doesn't draw the shadow
	at the screen edge. Should help us with our Fitt worshipping.

	* applet.c: comment out all gconf/configuration code
	for the moment and update everything to use PanelToplevel
	instead of BasePWidget and co.

	* button-widget.[ch]:
	(calculate_overlay_geometry): remove some overlaying which
	isn't needed anymore.
	(button_widget_realize), (button_widget_parent_set),
	(button_widget_get_property), (button_widget_set_property),
	(draw_arrow), (button_widget_expose),
	(button_widget_size_allocate), (button_widget_instance_init),
	(button_widget_class_init), (button_widget_new),
	(button_widget_new_from_stock), (button_widget_set_params):
	Update for toplevel changes plus use PanelOrientation everywhere
	instead of PanelOrient.

	* drawer.[ch]: re-write big chunks of this to use PanelToplevel.
	None of this is really tested, though, and is broken atm.

	* global-keys.c: (panel_global_keys_filter): update for new
	autohide blocking mechanism.

	* gnome-run.c: update for multiscreen/a11y function renaming.

	* launcher.c: update to use PanelToplevel.

	* main.c: (main): various updates and kill initial state change
	crack.

	* menu-util.c: upd for multiscreen renaming.

	* menu.c: (menuitem_to_screen), (menu_on_screen),
	(add_app_to_panel), (add_drawers_from_dir),
	(add_menudrawer_to_panel), (add_menu_to_panel), (show_item_menu),
	(add_drawer_to_panel), (add_action_button_to_panel),
	(add_menu_bar_to_panel), (add_launcher), (menu_deactivate),
	(add_bonobo_applet): various unexciting updates.
	(find_empty_pos_array), (find_empty_pos),
	(find_empty_edge), (find_empty_border_and_anchor): disable all
	this initial panel position code until I figure out how to
	replace it.

	your saved configuration its going to be missing the

2003-01-10  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* gnome-panel/panel.c, gnome-panel/session.c,

	bother strdup-ing the stock ids.

2002-09-12  Soeren Sandmann  <sandmann@daimi.au.dk>

	* menu.c:
	(do_icons_to_add), (load_icons_handler):
	Delay actually setting the icon on the GtkImage
	until we have loaded all the icons. This fixes

	* drawer-widget.c: (drawer_pos_get_pos):

	Fixes #90317 by explicitly destroying panels on receipt
	of a Die from the session manager rather than just
	exiting the mainloop. Apparently embedded out of process
	embedded windows don't cope with this too well - thanks
	to Owen for pointing this fact out.

	* applet.c:
	(panel_applet_clean): do anything required to effect
	permanent removal of the applet here.
	(applet_idle_remove): kill set_clean_remove stuff.
	(panel_applet_destroy): only clear up our data and refs
	here rather than permanently removing the applet.

	* basep-widget.c: remove some bogus whitepsace.

	* menu.c: (remove_panel_accept): if the panel is a drawer,
	then also remove the associated applet. Permanently remove

	(panel_applet_get_clean_remove), (popup_handle_remove),

	* gnome-panel-screenshot.c: Apply patch from Owen Taylor for bug

2002-07-13  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

        Try fixing panel to allow Mod2-Mod5 accels. This fix is a drop in
	the bucket though, this code needs a lot of help.
	
	* eggaccelerators.h: copy in from libegg to use in fixing
	global-keys.c. evil cut-and-paste code.

	* global-keys.c (grab_key): dynamically get ignored mods

	* applet.c: (panel_applet_save_position): don't
	save the position backwards if it isn't a packed
	panel. The saved position only has the effect of
	ordering the applets on packed panels, not actually
	specifying the position. Fixes #90598.

2002-08-13  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Register all panel icons with GtkIconFacory and
	use stock ids when rendering icons. Also register
	two named icon sizes to allow future icon size
	theming. Fixes #89063.

	* panel-stock-icons.h: list of stock ids.

	(panel_menu_icon_get_size), (panel_foobar_icon_get_size):
	accessors for our named GtkIconSizes.
	(panel_init_stock_icons): register stock icons here. Default
	to GTK_STOCK_MISSING_IMAGE if we can't find the icon. Note,
	that GnomeIconLoader is still used to lookup the icon path
	first, so you can still theme these icons using GnomeIconLoader,
	except the gtk theme will override it. Not sure how much sense
	that really makes.
	(panel_init_stock_items): register our modified stock gtk items
	here (only the run button currently).
	(panel_init_stock_icons_and_items): call both of the above but
	also register our named icon sizes.

	* Makefile.am: add panel-stock-icons.[ch] to the
	build.

	* distribution.c: use stock icons.

	* distribution.h: s/menu_icon/stock_icon/

	* foobar-widget.c: (append_actions_menu),

	(register_run_stock_item): moved into panel-stock-icons.c.
	(show_run_dialog): s/PANEL_STOCK_RUN/PANEL_STOCK_EXECUTE/.

	* main.c: (main): init stock icons.

	* menu-fentry.h: kill MenuFinfo::pixmap_name. Seems to have been
	totally unused. Also removed a pile of related code from menu.c.

	* menu-util.[ch]: (stock_menu_item_new): rename pixmap_menu_item_new
	and use stock ids instead of filenames.

	(image_menuitem_size_request): actually lookup the icon size.
	(applet_menu_get_category_icon): use a hash of stock ids instead
	of filenames.
	(create_applet_menu): use stock icons for categories. Applet icons
	should be themed with GnomeIconLoader.
	(create_add_panel_submenu): use stock icons.
	(setup_stock_menu_item): rename from setup_menuitem_try_pixmap.
	(make_add_submenu): use stock icons.
	(make_panel_submenu), (create_panel_submenu): use panel icon size,
	instead of gtk icon size.
	(create_desktop_menu): (add_distribution_submenu),
	(add_kde_submenu), (create_root_menu): use stock icons.
	(panel_load_menu_image_deferred_with_size): allow the use of 
	stock icons and filenames.
	(panel_load_menu_image_deferred): actually lookup the icon size.

	* menu.h: remove create_menu*, they're static now.

2002-08-11  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* drawer.c: (drawer_save_to_gconf): save the
	associated panel when saving the drawer.

	* main.c: (main): don't kill free drawers. They're
	not used at this point because we're loading drawers
	in idle now. Fixes #90443.

2002-08-11  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* gnome-panel-screenshot.glade: kill the seperator.

2002-08-11  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* gnome-run.c: (remove_parameters): impl stripping
	desktop item Exec parameters.
	(sync_list_to_entry): Use it when setting the entry
	from the treeview. Fixes #90200.

2002-08-11  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* edge-widget.c: (edge_widget_new): hey ! edge widgets
	shouldn't have packed PanelWidgets should they? Well,
	they have since Aug99 ... very, very confused.

	* panel-applet-frame.[ch]: (panel_applet_frame_get_size_hints):
	return the number of hints, not the hints themselves.

	* panel-widget.c:
	(allocate_dirty_child), (panel_widget_size_request),
	(panel_widget_size_allocate): handle expanding applets
	on 'packed' panels. Fixes #89266.

2002-08-07 Padraig O'Briain  <padraig.obriain@sun.com>

	* menu.c (create_new_panel): Call gtk_window_present() to give

	(panel_show_help), (panel_show_gnome_help),

	add a GdkScreen* arg and use the egg_screen_help
	variants in all of these.

	* applet.c, launcher.c, menu-ditem.c, menu.c,
	  panel-config.c: pass a GdkScreen* to the help
	functions and use egg_screen_url_show instead of
	gnome_url_show.

2002-08-07  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* Makefile.am: link against XSHAPE_LIBS. Fixes #90000.

	* gnome-panel-screenshot.c: (take_window_shot):
	dont' use the shape extension if the header wasn't
	found.

2002-08-06  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Fixes #84744, applets not loading in the correct order,
	by loading all types of applets in the idle handler, in
	the same order as they should appear on the panels.

	* applet.c:
	(panel_applet_load_idle_handler): handle loading all types
	of applets.

	* button-widget.[ch], launcher.c, logout.c, darawer.c, menu.c,
	  panel-util.h: redo the icon loading logic a bit and leave more

Wed May 22 10:50:23 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnome-run.c: fix #82428 by focusing the entry on show.  Also zero
	  out the GValue when trying to get icon, this should get rid of

	  stuff since there is no longer such an applet fixes #82593

	* menu.c: fix sim menu refcounting

	* menu-ditem.c: save after 2 seconds of inactivity.  5 was too long

2002-05-22  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* applet.c: (panel_applet_load_from_unique_id),
	(panel_applet_save_position): interpret the meaning of
	the 'right_stick' property slightly differently to
	fix #76925. This will break the ordering of your applets
	the first time you load a panel with this fix.

2002-05-22  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* applet.c: (whack_applet_to_load): kill setting

	  gnome-run.c, menu-fentry.c, menu.c, panel-config-global.c,
	  panel-util.c, panel-widget.c, panel.c:  Tried to verify GSList
	  code and while at it did a bunch of slist code cleanup.  Also
	  I HATE !strcmp with a passion so I changed all such instances
	  to strcmp(a, b) == 0.

	* basep-widget.c: some more descriptive property names/descs

Fri May 17 21:34:44 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel-shell.c: fix #81437 by disconnecting the destroy
	  function on response before we do gtk_dialog_run

	* menu.c: don't do gtk_dialog_run on something returned from
	  panel_error_dialog.  Hmmm, will need some better idea for the
	  closing instead of hard destroying the thing which causes crashes

	  parent == NULL

Fri May 17 21:14:16 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* multiscreen-stuff.c: when the screen is invalid, assume the zero
	  (the first) screen, Fixes #70095.  It is probably the saner
	  behaviour since that makes sure that at least SOME panel is
	  visible.

	* menu.[ch], foobar-widget.[ch]: s/run_item/extra_items/ and
	  don't add the search and screenshot item on foobar like we
	  do with the run item

	  of cool stuff

	* gnome-run.c, menu-fentry.[ch]: add an exec field to the FileRec
	  so that we can add an EXEC column.  Also add an icon column so
	  that for the icon lookup we do no loading of entries.  Should
	  reduce overhead of icon lookup by quite a bit.

	* gnome-run.c, menu.c: Modify error dialogs to all use the
	  bold/details style that is used elsewhere in the panel

Tue May 14 11:37:24 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* menu.c: move the screenshot/search to a more appropriate location,
	  one where it actually works all the time, and now it's not such a
	  dirty hack (since that's the way the runbox is done) so remove
	  that comment

	* multiscreen-stuff.c: add checking for "GNOME_PANEL_NO_XINERAMA"
	  env var, and if it exists ignore xinerama.  This is a quick
	  and simple workaround for #73475

	widget when the currently focused widget is removed from a panel
	(panel_widget_cremove): Call panel_widget_reset_focus() to reset
	focus when applet is removed from panel.
	(panel_widget_reparent): Set focus to new widget, unset GTK_CAN_FOCUS
	flag on new PanelWidget, if set, and make panel window active when 
	applet is moved from another panel.
	(panel_widget_tab_move): Do not unset saved_focus_widget after moving
	applet to another panel using Tab key.

	  really work since a bunch of stuff is still broken.

2002-03-04  Padraig O'Briain  <padraig.obriain@sun.com>

	* panel-widget.c:
	Tidy up keynav code: use keybindings for Tab and arrow keys only
	for moving applets; define panel_widget_real_focus as default
	signal handler for GtkWidget's focus signal so GtkWindow's
	key bindings are used to move focus when the PanelWidget has focus.

Fri Mar  1 22:09:26 2002  Soeren Sandmann  <sandmann@daimi.au.dk>

	* panel-config-global.c (panel_global_config_set_entry): fix typo:
	s/autoraise-panel/auto-raise-panel/

Fri Mar 01 10:35:55 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* aligned-widget.c: fix swapped parameters to g_signal_new,
	  yay for type-unsafety!  Yay!  We get to hunt down bugs like this

Wed Feb 27 23:58:15 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* applet.c, panel-applet-frame.[ch], session.c, panel.c: save
	  applet position on move, don't save it when we're removing the
	  applets.  Implement back the clean_remove setting for
	  bonobo_applets in preparation for the 'dead applet' dialog

	* basep-widget.[ch], menu.c, panel.c:  Try to figure out memory
	  issues with removing panels/applets.  The menu applet now removes
	  without a warning, but removing a panel will still corrupt memory
	  somewhere.  While I was at it I converted the Pos objects to
	  GObject rather then GtkObject, which gets rid of some sinking
	  issues.

	* menu-properties.c: remove a dead argument to a function

	* panel-widget.c: minor cleanup

2002-02-27  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* menu.c:

	the button notify handler temporarily. Fixes #72430.

Tue Feb 26 17:34:45 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel.c: fix #70518 among others, by queing a resize on all button
	  widgets.  Dunno what's up with that really, but this will force it
	  to work.  Also fixed up the panel move stuff to be a bit saner as
	  well, and fix a possible crash.

	* menu-util.[ch], menu.c: hmm, the menu menu is still off the button
	  and not at cursor location ... damnit

Tue Feb 26 16:17:09 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* menu-util.c: the applet menu should also be at the cursor location
	  fixes #70502

2002-02-25  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Dynamically apply the schemas to new profiles as they are

	* applet.c: update for gconf function name changes. Remove all

	to fix #69716.

	* drawer.[ch]:
	(properties_apply_callback): actually save properties changes.
	(load_drawer_applet): save the AppletInfo.
	(drawer_save_to_gconf), (drawer_load_from_gconf): update for gconf
	function name changes, cleanupa and don't try and save the tooltip
	when its null. Kill use_default stuff.

	* floating-widget.c: (floating_pos_get_hide_size),
	(floating_pos_get_hide_pos): read minimized size from the global_config
	struct, not gconf.

	* foobar-widget.c: (append_format_items): clock format is not in global

	function name changes.
	(launcher_file_name): use PANEL_LAUNCHERS_PATH.

	* panel-widget.c: (panel_widget_destroy), (panel_widget_get_by_id),
	(panel_widget_set_id): update for gconf renaming. Clean up.

	* panel.[ch]: lots of cleanups, update for gconf name changes, shorten
	function names, kill use_default stuff.

	  menu thing is synchronized.

2002-02-22  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* menu.c: Remove unsupported #ifdef ENABLE_NLS.
	
Thu Feb 21 18:15:42 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnome-run.c: load both the list of apps and then the icons
	  in idle time, so that we display the dialog immediately and then
	  load all this crap a bit later.  This makes the whole thing feel
	  a lot snappier.

Thu Feb 21 17:25:56 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* menu.c, panel.[ch]: when adding applets or launchers and such
	  things from the context menu, add them at the spot where the
	  context menu was triggered.

Thu Feb 21 15:49:33 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* basep-widget.c: properly do hidebutton sensitivities and tooltips
	  on startup and when changing orientation.  Should also hopefully
	  close #61419

2002-02-21  jacob berkman  <jacob@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): add $(ui_DATA)

2002-02-21  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	so it can be translated.

	* panel-applet-frame.c: (panel_applet_frame_construct): kill
	the static xml string and use the xml file instead.

Wed Feb 20 19:13:33 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* menu.[ch], applet.c, foobar-widget.c, gnome-run.c:  Add
	  panel_make_menu_icon, which exposes the pixbuf loading function
	  from the menu icon cache so that we can use it in other places,
	  such as the run box.

	* button-widget.c: use the desktop-item icon finding function for
	  icon finding

	* launcher.c: when getting the best launcher icon look for 48x48 and
	  not 20x20

Wed Feb 20 18:15:38 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* menu-fentry.c: sure_string the fullname before making a collation
	  key.

Wed Feb 20 18:12:25 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* menu-fentry.[ch], menu.c: the fr_compare function takes into
	  account directories being sorted before files.  MFiles can't be
	  sorted so sort after we load the QItems.  Fix a memory leak.  Cache
	  the scaled version of an icon to avoid lots of scaling and add
	  the icon size to the cache key.

Wed Feb 20 17:14:00 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnome-run.c, menu-fentry.[ch]: Add a fentry sorting function and
	  cache the name collate key, so that sorting is faster.  Also
	  properly sort menu items if no set sort order has been given by
	  a SortOrder thing in a .directory.  Also remove fr_get_all_dirs
	  since it's a stupid function and isn't being used anyway.

2002-02-20  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* main.c: (session_notify_global_changes): move notify
	handler to panel_global_config_notify.

	* panel-config-global.h: clean up and add
	panel_global_config_set_entry and panel_global_config_notify.

	* panel-global-config.schemas: kill "auto-update-menus".

	* panel-util.[ch]: (panel_parse_accelerator): rename from
	convert_string_to_keysym_state and upd to handle
	GlobalConfigKeys.

	* global-keys.c: (panel_global_keys_setup),
	(panel_global_keys_filter): upd to use GlobalConfigKey.

	calc code to here.
	(stretch_widget_realize): use calc_gemoetry.

	before unmapping.

2002-02-19  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* menu.c: (compare_filerecs), (create_menu_at_fr): re-indent
	to same style as surrounding code and compress comments to
	one single explanatory comment outside the method.

2002-02-19  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* menu.c: (create_menuitem): revert unapproved increase of
	icon size to 32x32. Retain sensible cleanups, though.

2002-02-17  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	Fix #70512

	* gnome-run.c: add mnemonics to all labels, rename buttons.
	(browse): rename dialog.
	(run_dialog_response): if window was just closed, don't run command.
	(sort_by_name): Sort according to locale.
	(add_columns): Remove column header
	(create_simple_contents): Add label above list (so that	you can focus
	list with mnemonic). Make description label selectable, show Advanced
	options below "Advanced >>" button.
	

2002-02-16  Seth Nickell  <snickell@stanford.edu>

	finish updating panel docs for GNOME2

2002-02-16  Seth Nickell  <snickell@stanford.edu>

	* menu.c: (remove_pixmap_from_loaded), (load_icons_handler):

	Use weak refs rather than destroy signal, so we can
	use the pixbufs directly rather than needing a
	GtkWidget.

2002-02-16  Seth Nickell  <snickell@stanford.edu>

	* menu.c: (load_icons_handler), (create_kde_menu):

	Only cache the pixbufs as directly loaded from the icon
	files. That way if a smaller icon is loaded first
	we don't end up scaling it up later when its needed
	for a larger version.

	Really we should just include size as well as filename
	in the hashtable, but the number of calls is small
	enough that this isn't problematic.

2002-02-16  Seth Nickell  <snickell@stanford.edu>

	* menu.c: (compare_filerecs), (create_menu_at_fr),
	(applet_menu_get_category_icon):

	Sort menus into locale-correct "alphabetical" order.

2002-02-15  Michael Meeks  <michael@ximian.com>

	* panel-applet-frame.c (panel_applet_frame_construct): 
	don't get the 'shell' interface, it's not used and this

2002-02-15  Padraig O'Briain  <padraig.obriain@sun.com>

	* basep-widget.[ch] : Rename "focus_panel" signal to "move_focus_out"
	as same action (Ctrl+Tab) on DrawerWidget moves focus from
	DrawerWidget to Drawer. Add code to basep_widget_move_focus_out()
	to implement moving focus from DrawerWidget to Drawer.

	(basep_widget_construct) Sink BasePPos to avoid warning on panel
	deletion.

	* drawer-widget.c (drawer_widget_new): Do not allow panel in
	DrawerWidget to receive focus.

	* drawer.h (Drawer): Add two new fields moving_focus and jyst_focused.
	The field moving_focus is used to prevent drawer being closed
	when keyboard focus moves from Drawer to DrawerWidget and being
	opened whem keyboard focus moves from DrawerWidget to Drawer
	The field just_focused is used to prevent the drawer being closed
	when a Drawer, which does not have focus, is clicked.

	* drawer.c: Add signal handlers for focus_in_event, focus_out_event
	and key_press_event on Drawer.
	focus_in_drawer ensures that drawer is opened when focused
	focus_out_drawer ensures that drawer is closed when unfocused
	key_press_drawer implements arrow keys to move focus from Drawer to
	DrawerWidget and focus the first or last object on the panel and Escape
	to close the drawer.

	* foobar-widget.[ch] : Rename "focus_panel" signal to "move_focus_out"

	* panel-widget.c (panel_widget_focus): Do not configure.infocus panel for
	DrawerWidget

	* panel.c (panel_menu_get): Sink menu object to avoid warning on
	panel deletion

	Increase the size of the icons in the Applications menu to
	32x32.

2002-02-10  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* basep-widget.c (basep_widget_size_allocate): Consider the x/y
	position of the panel when setting struts. This means we get the
	right strut if some crack-smoker puts multiple panels on the same
	side of the screen. Currently only seems to matter for stacking an
	edge panel under the foobar.

2002-02-10  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* Makefile.am: use intltool for .desktop files.

	* panel-applet-frame.[ch]
	Add action signal move-focus_out_of_panel to move focus from applet to
	next or previous object on panel. Currently Tab and Shift+Tab are the 
	keys which do this.

	* foobar-widget.[ch]
	Add action signal focus_panel to support moving focus to the panel

	* panel.c:
	Remove unused argument PanelData specified for panel_event()

	not focus widget.

2002-02-06  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* gnome-run.c:
	(create_advanced_contents): don't set focus widget here, we do
	it later.
	(update_contents): focus the entry, not the vbox.

Tue Feb 05 17:48:58 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnome-run.c: set window icon

	* menu-util.c: remove the applets sub from the default menu flags

	* menu.c: About box fixups, use a logo, add documentors, fix
	  translation credits, and use the comment for the commie mode
	  paragraph.  Use the standard defaults when adding a menu.
	  When saving a ditem in the timeout, save the error and display
	  it in an error dialog when we close the property window.
	  Add more descriptive standard menu tooltips.  When there is
	  no full menu name use the directory basename rather then "Menu".
	  Translate the things from the bonobo server entry.  Use
	  a lazy hash for category->icon lookups, and use untranslated
	  category name to lookup icons.  Use standard panel error
	  dialog api for 'only one foobar' dialog.

	* panel-widget.c: unused var warning

	* xstuff.c: fix possible race (I'm anal, perhaps it's not a race
	  at all in fact, but it's not there anymore)
	  
2002-02-05  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* panel.c: (panel_session_init_panels): audit use of
	gconf_enum_to_string to make sure all (gint *) casts
	are correct. Solaris refuses to entertain mis-aligned
	pointers.

2002-02-04  jacob berkman  <jacob@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: our object files require the built sources

2002-02-04  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* launcher.c: (properties_apply): save the launcher.
	(launcher_save_to_gconf): don't save location if its not set.
	(launcher_file_name), (launcher_save): make static.
	(launcher_hoard): save to gconf.

	* launcher.h: kill launcher_file_name and launcher_save.

2002-02-04  Padraig O'Briain  <padraig.obriain@sun.com>

	* panel.c: Correct popping up of panel's context menu using keyboard.

2002-02-04  Padraig O'Briain  <padraig.obriain@sun.com>

	These changes update the changes which give focus to the panel and
	object on the panel to take account of the fix to bug 50339 which
	requires that a widget in a GtkWindow have focus initially, rather
	than the GtkWindow itself.

	* basep-widget.[ch]: Rename focus_return as the more meaningful name
	focus_panel. Remove the functions basep_widget_focus_in_event,
	basep_widget_focus_out_event and basep_widget_set_focus. Specify
	focus chain in basep_widget_construct so that focus goes initially to
	the panel.

	* panel-widget.[ch]:
	Add functions panel_widget_focus_in_event, which sets PRELIGHT state
	for panel and adds keybindings for Tab and Shift+Tab, and 
	panel_widget_focus_out_event, which unsets the PRELIGHT state for the
	panel, removes keybindings for Tab and Shift+Tab and unsets 
	GTK_WIDGET_CAN_FOCUS flag, if focus is going to another widget in the
	window. Rename move_to_panel to tab_move.
	Add key bindings for Tab and Shift+Tab when panel has focus or when in
	move mode. Set GTK_WIDGET_CAN_FOCUS flag on panel when it is created.
	Add code to panel_widget_tab_move to move focus to object in panel; 
	this requries unsetting GTK_WIDGET_CAN_FOCUS flag on panel.
	Add function panel_widget_focus which moves the focus from an object
	on the panel to the panel.
	
2002-02-04  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* gnome-panel-properties.glade.h:
	* gnome-panel-screenshot.glade.h: remove.

	* Makefile.am: remove .glade.h files.

	* applet.c, panel-applet-frame.c: fixup pre-conditions.

Fri Feb 01 17:00:02 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* foobar-widget.c, menu.[ch], menu-fentry.[ch]:  remove old applet
	  cruft

	* global-keys.c: call the run dialog yet again

	* menu.c: add some more people to the authors list in the about box,
	  incomplete though

	* menu.c, panel.c: handle applet dnd again, and reenable adding
	  applet menu as part of the main.  Though perhaps we should just
	  whack that completely.  Also fix a small leak.

2002-01-31  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* button-widget.c: (button_widget_class_init): kill
	binding_set.

	* panel-widget.c: (panel_widget_move_to_panel): initialise
	previous_panel.

2002-01-31  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* panel-marshal.list: Add VOID:BOOLEAN to fix build.

2002-01-31  Padraig O'Briain  <padraig.obriain@sun.com>

	* button-widget.[c], panel-widget.[ch] panel-marshal.lst: 
	Remove keyboard move functionality from ButtonWidget. It is now
	necessary to be in Move mode before it is possible to move applets
	using the keyboard.
	Tab or Shift+Tab will move applet to next or previous panel.
	Shift+arrow will push applet a small amount
	Control+arrow will switch applet
	Alt+arrow will free move an applet
	Escape will exit Move mode
 
Tue Jan 29 01:50:01 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* basep-widget.[ch], panel.c, floating-widget.c, drawer.c: the change
	  signal arguments now give the old value and by the time they
	  are emitted, the new value was already set.  Get rid of the
	  BASEP_MOVING state since it wasn't really treated as one and
	  add a ->moving flag.  When we hide the panel, make sure the
	  widgets that aren't visible are at least insensitive.  Also
	  autohide/autoshow now use idle when at 0 value.

2002-01-28  Seth Nickell  <snickell@stanford.edu>

	* menu.c: (create_root_menu):

	Replace "Execute" with "Run", to avoid using threatening
	language.

2002-01-28  Seth Nickell  <snickell@stanford.edu>

	* Makefile.am:
	* gnome-panel-properties.desktop:

	Install into the new CC capplets location.

2002-01-28  Anders Carlsson  <andersca@gnu.org>

	* gnome-run.c (add_columns): Use a single tree view column
	and pack both cell renderers in it. 
	(create_simple_contents): Add a shadow to the scrolled window.

2002-01-28  Padraig O'Briain  <padraig.obriain@sun.com>

	Initial implementation of keyboard move functionality for ButtonWidget.
	* button-widget.[ch]
	Define action signals "push-move", "switch-move" and "free-move"
	and associate keybindings with them
	Implement default signal handlers button_widget_push_move,
	button_widget_switch_move, button_widget_free_move

	* panel-widget.[ch]
	Define action signal end-move to allow termination of move using
	keyboard. Use Escape as keybinding for this action. This is different
	from Calum's original spec but I have discussed it with him.
	Update panel_sub_event_handler() and panel_widget_applet_event() so 
	that Escape causes panel_widget_end_move() is called.
	Add panel_widget_push_applet, panel_widget_switch_applet,
	panel_widget_free_move_applet to implement "push-move", "switch-move"
	and "free-move"
	Remove calls to g_return_if_fail (foo != NULL) if followed by calls
	to g_return_if_fail (GTK_IS_BAR (foo));
	
2002-01-27  Seth Nickell  <snickell@stanford.edu>

	* panel-per-panel-config.schemas:

	And switch seconds off to minimize the disturbance caused
	by the resizing problems.

2002-01-27  Seth Nickell  <snickell@stanford.edu>

	* panel-per-panel-config.schemas:

	Move "pager" into the upper right hand corner.

2002-01-27  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* foobar-widget.c, panel.c: Hopefully fixes bug #69838.

2002-01-26  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* panel-per-panel-config.schemas: Bugger, forgot to hide the hide
	buttons.

2002-01-26  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* applet.c: Change right-stick to panel-right-stick. It still doesn't 
	really describe to the user what it is, but it's a bit more intuitive.
	* panel-per-panel-config.schemas: Add in a few applets and change things
	around according to Nils' proposal. [Still perhaps missing some icons?].

2002-01-26  Roy-Magne Mo <rmo@sunnmore.net>

	* panel.hints: syncronizing panel.hints 
	  with the gnome-1-4 core. This means
          adding nn and sl languages.

Thu Jan 24 16:20:47 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* menu.c: fix the reposition hack not to spew warnings

Wed Jan 23 18:20:13 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* menu.[ch], menu-util.c, applet.c, foobar-widget.c:  Make sure
	  menus appear within xinerama boundaries.  Those that don't like
	  menu.c style of coding should NOT look at this code.  But it
	  works.

	* multiscreen-stuff.c: reorder the screens in the fake debugging
	  setup.

	* basep-widget.c: fix screen_change signal signature

	* foobar-widget.c: add some corners.  Yay we half look like a mac
	  now.  Now if we could only get bottom corners as well.  Maybe
	  in time.

2002-01-23  Padraig O'Briain  <padraig.obriain@sun.com>

	* applet.c: Add applet_do_popup_menu() and applet_popup_menu() to
	support popping up of menu using Shift+F10 for buttons on the panel.

	* basep_widget.c (base_widget_focus_return):
	Update to forget previously focussed widget so that Ctrl+Tab followed
	by Tab gives always gives focus to first button 

	* menu.c: Add menu_button_menu_popup() and menu_button_notify() to
	support menu popup when menu icon receives focus.
	Define callback for "clicked" to be menu_button_pressed so that
	pressing Enter or Space on a focussed menu icon activates its menu.
	
Tue Jan 22 16:11:47 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* quick-desktop-reader.c: when testing for tryexec, just do an
	  access (foo, X_OK) if it's an absolute filename.  Also put
	  the debug conditional around ALL the g_prints

2002-01-22  Anders Carlsson  <andersca@gnu.org>

	* button-widget.c: Lower the button displacement.

2002-01-22  Padraig O'Briain  <padraig.obriain@sun.com>

	* basep_widget.c: Add new function basep_widget_move_focus to
	implement GtkWidgetClass's move_focus; it causes a icon in the panel
	to receive focus initially instead of hide/show button when Tab is
	pressed when the panel has focus

Mon Jan 21 19:20:06 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* logout.c: block the logout signal while we're in the signal handler

	* main.c: remove the I'm on crack dialog.  it's pissing the shit out
	  of me.  So we're no longer elitist.  Plus the panel shouldn't screw
	  up your old config now so it should be ok.

	* xstuff.[ch]: remove the nautilus check thing, it's broken and
	  not used anyway

2002-01-21  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* panel-global-config.schemas, panel-per-panel-config.schemas: Add 
	xml tags to these files.

Mon Jan 21 00:50:06 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel.c: use g_filename_from_uri

2002-01-20  Seth Nickell  <snickell@stanford.edu>

	* main.c: (tell_user_Im_on_crack):

	Mr. Picky Strikes! Remove the separator from
	the dialog as per the HIG.

2002-01-19  Seth Nickell  <snickell@stanford.edu>

	* menu.c: (create_add_panel_submenu):
	* panel-config.c: (update_config_type), (panel_config):

	Rename "Aligned panel" to "Corner panel".

	Add pixmaps for the menu items under "Create panel->".
	
2002-01-19  Seth Nickell  <snickell@stanford.edu>

	* menu.c: (create_applets_menu), (make_add_submenu),
	(create_root_menu):

	Start collapsing Applet submenu into the "add" submenu. The distinction
	between applets and other "things you can put on the panel" isn't very
	clear and is primarily a technical distinction (particular for objects
	such as the status dock. This looks bigger, but its the amount of data
	many users effectively have to sift through to find what they're looking
	for. Now we can confront the problem of better categorization head on.

2002-01-19  Seth Nickell  <snickell@stanford.edu>

	* gnome-panel-properties.glade:

	Reword "on mouseover" to "when the mouse moves over them". Yeah,
	its longer, but its also a lot more natural (and still not the
	longest string in that dialog ;-)
	
	* menu.c: (create_panel_context_menu):
	* menu.h:
	* panel.c: (panel_menu_get):

	panels rather than a "full" Main menu.

2002-01-17  Padraig O'Briain  <padraig.obriain@sun.com>

	* basep_widget.c: Fill in panel background with prelight color/pixmap 
	when panel has focus. This requires introducing new function
	basep_widget_focus_in_event, base_widget_focus_out_widget,
	basep_widget_set_focus

Thu Jan 17 01:43:20 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel-util.[ch], applet.c, basep-widget.c, drawer.c, logout.c,
	  menu.c: Some renaming of functions and minor cleanup of cruft.

	* panel-applet-frame.c, applet.c, panel.c:  Don't use the 'data'
	  field to store the frame, that's what the 'widget' item is for

	* xstuff.c, swallow.c: port the status and swallow checking to
	  libwnck and some swallowing cleanup including a ditem launch
	  error dialog

Wed Jan 16 18:14:43 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel-util.c, menu.c: a bit more work on error dialogs,
	  also have the error/info dialogs use the markup.

2002-01-16 Stephen Browne <stephen.browne@sun.com>

	* distribution.c

	changed the file to look for on Solaris

2002-01-16  Glynn Foster <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* TODO: Update

2002-01-16  Padraig O'Briain  <padraig.obriain@sun.com>

	* basep_widget.[ch]
	Add "focus_return" signal to return focus from a child widget to the
	panel. Define key binding (Ctrl+Tab) to activate focus_return.
	Remove calls to g_return_if_fail (foo != NULL) if followed by calls
	to g_return_if_fail (GTK_IS_BAR (foo));

Wed Jan 16 01:01:38 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* applet.[ch], panel-applet-frame.c: Make sure the AppletInfo is
	  freed, fix a possible race with applet destruction.  There are
	  some somewhat evil things still around here.  Fear.

	* panel-util.[ch], applet.c, gnome-run.c, menu-fentry.c, menu.c, 
	  panel.c: make deep_free list functions and use them

Tue Jan 15 15:05:46 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* button-widget.[ch], panel-types.h, drawer.c, menu.c, launcher.c,
	  logout.c:  Remove the button widget type enum, it's not needed
	  without tiles

	* button-widget.c: draw the focus frame thingie over the icon
	  if we are focused.  You can now tab between launchers and
	  see where you are :)

	* panel-util.c: some warning fixes

2002-01-15  Padraig O'Briain  <padraig.obriain@sun.com>

	* menu-util.c (panel_menu_position):
	Ensure that menu position is close to panel even if popped up by
	keystroke.

	* panel.c:
	Add panel_do_popup_menu() and panel_popup_menu() to support popping
	up of menu using Shift+F10

2002-01-14  Padraig O'Briain  <padraig.obriain@sun.com>

	reviewed by: Mark McLoughlin <mark@skynet.ie>

	* basep_widget.c  foobar-widget.c menu.c 
	Use GtkButton's in_button field instead of ButtonWidget's

	* button-widget.[ch]:
	Derive ButtonWidget from GtkButton instead of GtkWidget; use
	GtkButton's pressed, released and clicked signals instead of signals
	defined in ButtonWidget; ButtonWidget now can receive focus and react
	to keystrokes.
	Remove calls to g_return_if_fail (foo != NULL) if followed by calls
	to g_return_if_fail (GTK_IS_BAR (foo));
	
2002-01-14  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* Makefile.am: distcheck fix.

Mon Jan 14 01:40:25 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* launcher.c, panel-util.[ch]: Add a directory ensuring function
	  that ensures the whole path exists and use it instead of mkdir
	  when hoarding launchers.  This seems to make things work for me.

2002-01-14  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* Makefile.am: Make dist fixes. Actually these probably don't
	help at all...it's any excuse to get it to build ;)

2002-01-13  Alexander Larsson  <alla@lysator.liu.se>

	* panel-util.[ch]:
	Make convert_string_to_keysym_state() use gtk_accelerator_parse()
	and convert_keysym_state_to_string() use gtk_accelerator_name().

	* gnome-panel-properties.glade:
	Convert to new keysym string format.

	* panel-config-global.h:
	Make the _state variables GdkModifierType.

	* panel-widget.[ch]:
	Remove "applet_draw" signal.
	
2002-01-12  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	disappears. Fixes #68596.

2002-01-12  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* main.c: (main): Add in the name of the executable to avoid
	crashing on logout. Thanks to owen for spotting this. Everyone
	else is too afraid to run gnome-session :)

2002-01-11  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* panel-gconf.c: (panel_gconf_dir_exists): use GError.

	* Makefile.am, foobar-widget.c, menu.[ch], panel-config.c,
	  panel-util.c, panel.c, session.c, tearoffitem.[ch]:
	  Remove tearoff menus, they sucked.  We can readd them when
	  we implement them properly.

	* gnome-run.c:  Port to TreeView, so we are now completely
	  de-deprecated.  Also read from all-applications:/  To
	  actually allways get all entries.

	Okay, I've already forgotten what has gone into this patch. Think I've 
	got the global propeties animation speed thing nailed. Tweaked the default
	schema just enough to get everyone pissed because the panel won't load up
	for them. Make everyone happy and tell them that it's only a short 'rm -rf'
	command away from panel utopia...until I break it the next time. Moved some 
	stuff around to where it makes more sense. Now I'm seeing elephant trunks
	in my ChangeLog...I need to sleep.

Thu Jan 03 14:56:46 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* basep-widget.c: fix possible GList mempool corruption

	* gnome-run.c: look for pixmaps in app directories as well.

2002-01-02  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* panel-gconf.c, session.c: I am an ass. Use gconf_client instead
	of gconf_engine. Don't know what I was thinking about. Anyway, it 
	works okay now, although doesn't unlink the directory, although
	there's probably a way of doing that.

2002-01-02  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* panel-gconf.c, panel-widget.c, session.c, session.h: 
	Implemented new session_remove_panel_config () function to clean
	up the gconf database after we start removing panels. Doesn't work
	at all yet, but it doesn't make things crash which is a bonus.

2002-01-01  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>
	 
	* config/Makefile.am, config/panel.config,
	* config/panel.global: Removed, old crusty config stuff

	config still, I want to look at that.
	
	* main.c, menu.c, session.c, session.h: Removed some more crufty 
	code that we don't need anymore. Mark tearoff loading FIXME'd.

2001-12-31  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* panel-gconf.c, panel-gconf.h, session.c: 

	All because the lady likes new API. Implemented / copied code for
	a recursive unset of a gconf directory. Nothing uses it yet, but 
	it soon will.
	
2001-12-30  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* panel-per-panel-config.schemas: Complete the schema for

2001-12-30  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* panel-gconf.c, session.c: 

	1:30am + 6 hours of tv = mushed (brain). Think I've got all
	the panels saving and loading properly now. They even do 
	session management, but I'm too scared to run gnome-session-2 to
	check if that actually works.

Fri Dec 28 03:00:03 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* foobar-widget.c: correctly handle icon changing

	* menu.c: Fix some ugliness around the applets menu, still
	  much ugliness prevails

	* session.c: fix a few leaks.  When we find no panels install
	  a menu panel and tell the user.  Else the user would have no
	  interface to fix his configuration.

	  and all except gnome-run.c with GTK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED

	* foobar-widget.c: always convert to utf8 after getting something
	  from strftime

Wed Dec 26 14:01:24 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* foobar-widget.c: fix width of clock label.  Now if the time
	  'grows' beyond initial size then the label grows as well (it never
	  shrinks horizontally though, unless you change the format)

	* nothing.cP: we need pause

Wed Dec 26 12:03:37 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel-gconf.c: fix default return for get_string

	* nothing.cP: a bit more evil was required here

Tue Dec 25 16:13:56 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* nothing.cP: some more evil

Tue Dec 25 15:51:27 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnome-run.c, nothing.cP, nothing.h: Since I suppose one shouldn't
	  be productive during christmass to not seem like a loser, I wasn't
	  actually productive.  GEGLs ARE INVADING!

	* menu.c: cosmetic change

Mon Dec 24 01:55:19 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel.c, panel-util.[ch]: deal with dropped uris a tad better and
	  actually use gnome-vfs more.  Still kind of stupid and needs more
	  work, but better then before.  We should now again handle drops
	  from the menus since those were not from a 'file:' uri's.  Also
	  drop the shell quoting routine since we already have that in glib.

	* panel-widget.c: a bit of constization

Sat Dec 22 23:12:54 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Makefile.am, foobar-widget.c, gnome-panel-screenshot.c, panel.c,
	  session.c: Compile with G_DISABLE_DEPRECATED and
	  GNOME_DISABLE_DEPRECATED

Sat Dec 22 17:14:50 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* foobar-widget.c, menu.[ch], main.c: redo how the updating of
	  icons and tearoffs keys is done, load the foobar items in the
	  deffered way as well and sanitize this whole bit somewhat more.
	  It now fully nicely updates when you set/unset the icons/tearoff
	  keys.  And without having to reread folders.

	* gnome-panel-properties.c, gnome-run.c, launcher.c,
	  menu-properties.c, menu.c, panel-config.c, swallow.c:
	  Make dialog window settings sane after mucking with them.

	* gnome-panel-screenshot.c: get rid of tempnam usage to avoid warning

Sat Dec 22 15:12:42 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* foobar-widget.c, gnome-run.c, panel-config.c, swallow.c: fix up
	  the size request stuff so we get back some widgets which
	  disappeared because I was a wanker.

Sat Dec 22 14:52:42 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnome-panel-screenshot.c, gnome-panel-properties.c, status.c:
	  more fixes.  Having things actually compile is usually good.

Sat Dec 22 13:56:23 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	  panel-util.c, panel.c, panel.h, status-docklet.c, status.c,
	  swallow.c, xstuff.c: Yet more de-deprecation.  Now all that's
	  left is the clist stuff in gnome-run, but jrb says he has a
	  new runbox in production so it seems pointless to spend time
	  on porting that now.

	  some warning fixes etc...

2001-12-21  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* panel-gconf.c, session.c: Big heap of debug crap. It should
	help someone trying to figure out the profile stuff because I'm
	not going to fix it until after Christmas. Yeesh, like I should 
	be out drinking at this very moment. May your Christmas give you
	a warm tingly feeling and most importantly, have the craic...

	  <mibus@bigpond.com> to correctly set the initial sensitivity

Wed Dec 19 20:15:09 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* foobar-widget.c: an evil hack stolen from tasklist to set some
	  style properties such as the bevel type and internal padding

	* gnome-run.c, launcher.c, menu-properties.c, menu.c,
	  quick-desktop-reader.[ch]: use the new icon finding routines from

	* menu.c: don't prepend home dir to distro menu paths, these
	  are uris now

2001-12-19  Seth Nickell  <snickell@stanford.edu>

2001-12-19  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* main.c, menu.c, panel-applet-frame.c, panel-gconf.c,
	* panel-gconf.h, session.c, session.h:

	Move the get and set methods for the profiles to session where 
	they probably belong. Start saving the panel config per profile.
	It's like totally buggy right now, but it's sort of getting there.
	Panels crash because of lack of schema.

2001-12-18  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* basep-widget.c (basep_widget_realize): remove

	* xstuff.c (xstuff_window_raise_on_current_wspace): this was all a

2001-12-18  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

2001-12-17  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* panel-per-panel-config.schemas, session.c: Change code to use

	This patch will upset quite a lot of people. The move towards
	gconf and profiles Part I "Oh What a Tangled Web we Weave". Please
	don't look at the code, it's horrible. Basically we now have a 
	default schema for small, medium and large screens. The panel will 
	in future take a --profile option to load a profile. For now, applet
	inits don't work, panel inits are taken from the 'small' profile. Don't 
	file bugs about panel not saving, we know.
		
2001-12-17  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* gnome-run.c, launcher.c, menu-properties.c, menu.c, panel-config.c,
	swallow.c: use GTK_RESPONSE_* instead of custom *_BUTTON

	* drawer.c: reenable property apply code

Fri Dec 14 16:41:23 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* menu.[ch], launcher.c: some deFIXMEization.  Remove some dead
	  code, add some error handeling, fix some comments.  Directory
	  only ditem entry set, and also init type for applications.  Also
	  what the hint stuff from the tearoff menus.  It wouldn't work
	  properly anyway and it's supposed to be handled by the WM
	  anyway.  Also hardcode default to true for icons and tearoff keys,
	  and re-enable the use of the gconf key in the icons thing.  Also
	  use the new key for icons.  I can't find a tearoff one.  Is there
	  one?

	  gnome-panel-properties.glade:  Remove the user large icons,
	  avoid collissions and merge menus config options and keys and
	  all that.  large icons were gone already, merged menus as well,
	  and who would ever want to turn off collision avoidance.  Also
	  fix some memleaks and some cleanups.

Wed Dec 12 12:47:38 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	  work everywhere, only for menus that use check_reread

	  workspace for windows and use it for all the dialogs where
	  we only always have one copy of.  So that say the run dialog
	  will appear on your workspace even if it's open on another
	  one already

	* session.c: add to the auto-update-menus conversation warning

2001-12-09  Anders Carlsson  <andersca@gnu.org>

	* menu.c (get_panel_from_menu_data): Use gtk_menu_get_attach_widget
	to traverse up in the menu hierchary. Thanks to Owen Taylor for
	suggesting this.

	* applet.c: (panel_applet_add_callback), (setup_an_item),
	(applet_setup_panel_menu), (panel_applet_create_menu):
	Ref/Sink our menu, scale the panel menu icon.
	
	* main.c: (main): Don't respawn if I_LOVE_PANEL_CRACK is set.
	
	* menu.c: (setup_full_menuitem): gtk_widget_show our image.
	
	* panel.c: (drop_urilist): Implement so we can dnd urls to the panel.

Sun Dec 09 03:34:18 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Makefile.am, tasklist_icon.[ch], foobar-widget.c, main.c, menu.c,
	  xstuff.c: remove the gwmh and gstc hack stuff and remove them from
	  build and also remove the tasklist_icon.[ch] as well.  We use
	  libwnck now:)

Sun Dec 09 03:25:13 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* foobar-widget.c, menu-util.[ch]: initial crack at porting the
	  tasklist thing to libwnck, reenable the clock menu thing, use main
	  menu stuff for the "applications" menu so that we can get a KDE
	  and/or distribution submenu and remove some dead code

	* menu.[ch], foobar-widget.c, menu-fentry.h: whack the title flags
	  from things.  Menu titles are long dead

	* applet.c: also launch nautilus for edit menus

Sat Dec 08 23:16:39 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* menu.[ch], menu-fentry.h, menu-util.c, menu-properties.c,
	  session.c, main.c, gnome-run.c:  Remove favourites menu.  It is
	  useless with the current push towards editable menus.  Also instead
	  of running gedit, run nautilus on programs:/ as a menu editor.

	* panel-widget.c: fix warning.

	* applet.c, foobar-widget.c: use gtk image menu items instead of
	  normal items where appropriate.

Sat Dec 08 11:28:37 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnome-run.c, launcher.c, menu.c, swallow.c:  Use the new desktop
	  item launch api.

2001-12-07  Alex Larsson  <alexl@redhat.com>

	* button-widget.[ch]:
	Draw buttons using gdk-pixbuf instead of libart, should
	be faster and more correct.

	* panel-widget.c (make_background): Take a rowstride arg.
	(queue_resize_on_all_applets): New function
	(send_draw_to_all_applets): Use pixbuf
	(panel_widget_change_params): Queue resize on applets.

2001-12-08  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* gnome-run.c, gnome-run.h, menu.c,
	panel.c, session.c:  Whack gnome-run button applet thing which
	serves very little purpose.

2001-12-08  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* launcher.c: (setup_button): Make adding launchers not crash.

Fri Dec 07 14:48:01 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* xstuff.[ch], basep-widget.c, foobar-widget.c: add an extra type
	  for autohide panels so that windowmanagers can behave more nicely.

2001-12-07  Alexander Larsson  <alla@lysator.liu.se>

	* launcher.c (launcher_file_name):
	mkdir launcer directory if it doesn't exist.

2001-12-06  Alexander Larsson  <alla@lysator.liu.se>

	* panel-widget.c:
	Fixed off-by-one pixel error with expand_major that made broke
	switching between horz/vertical with a tasklist at the end.

2001-12-06  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* session.c: (session_read_global_config): fix sillys.

2001-12-06  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* session.c: (session_read_global_config): cast to
	GConfEntry. Weird - gconf does this itself, but it seems
	to break some things.

2001-12-06  Alexander Larsson  <alla@lysator.liu.se>

	* launcher.c (launcher_save):
	launcher_get_unique_file renamed to launcher_get_unique_uri,
	now returns file: uri.

Wed Dec 05 19:04:58 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* xstuff.[ch], basep-widget.[ch], foobar-widget.c:  Set the WM_STRUT
	  hint for panels

2001-12-05  Alex Larsson  <alexl@redhat.com>

	* launcher.c (create_launcher):
	Don't only load from file: uri's. This makes it at least do something
	for program: uris.

2001-12-05  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* basep-widget.c: Fix segfault George.
	* session.c: Start using GConfChangeSet. Dunno
	if this is really necessary or not.

2001-12-05  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* foobar-widget.c: Make it use bugzilla.
	* help/no/panel.sgml: Update.
		
Wed Dec 05 13:36:43 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* aligned-widget.[ch], basep-widget.[ch],
	  border-widget.[ch], drawer-widget.[ch],
	  edge-widget.[ch], floating-widget.[ch],
	  drawer.c, menu.c, panel_config.[ch],
	  session.c, sliding-widget.[ch]:  Remove the avoid
	  on maximize configuration crack.  It was just pure
	  crack.  With WM_STRUT we should be mostly sane
	  on this issue anyway.

	* basep-widget.[ch]: whack some of the old hint stuff
	  and make user the update_winhints virtual method
	  is called

	* applet.c: fix warning.

	* xstuff.[ch]: add some api for atom interning, that
	  caches atoms per display, and be in general more
	  multiple display safe.  Also use X atoms only and
	  not GdkAtoms.  Also implement checking for _NET
	  standard being supported.  We'll screw the old
	  gnome hitns and just have two states:  _NET
	  supported or completely dumb WM (use override
	  redirect).  Add a WM_STRUT setting function (not
	  yet actually used.

2001-12-04 Stephen Browne <stephen.browne@sun.com>

	* gnome-panel-properties.c
	* gnome-panel-properties.glade
	Updated GUI and made enable animations work

2001-12-04  Alex Larsson  <alexl@redhat.com>

	* applet.c (panel_applet_register):
	Call panel_applet_frame_get_expand_flags
	set insert_at_pos to FALSE if !exactpos.

	* panel-applet-frame.[ch]
	(panel_applet_frame_get_expand_flags): new function

	* panel-widget.[ch]:
	Implement expand_major and expand_minor for applets.

2001-12-04  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Load all global entries at once.

	* panel-gconf.[ch]:
	(panel_gconf_all_global_entries): impl.

	* session.c: (session_read_global_config): use.

2001-12-04  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Cache "menus-have-icons" and "menus-have-tearoff"
	keys with notification.

	* menu.[ch]:

	(setup_title_menuitem), (setup_full_menuitem), (menu_add_tearoff),

	(setup_menuitem_try_pixmap): upd.

	* tearoffitem.c: (tearoff_item_new): upd.

	* foobar-widget.c: (pixmap_menu_item_new), (add_tearoff): upd.

2001-12-04  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* main.c: (main), panel-gconf.c, panelglobalconfig.schemas:
	  session.c, session.h:

	Small amount of work to clean up the session stuff..More later.

2001-12-03  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* extern.c, session.c, session.h: 
	s/load_up_globals/load_global_config. Can't be arsed doing much
	more on this until this evening.
	
	* main.c: The most useful commit of the panel2's history thus 
	far. Use 'I_LOVE_PANEL_CRACK' to get rid of that fucking annoying
	caveat dialog.

2001-12-03  Malcolm Tredinnick <malcolm@commsecure.com.au>
	* menu.c: Replace a bunch of references to .gnome/ with the
	  GNOME_DOT_GNOME constant from <libgnome/gnome-init.h>. For
	  now, this makes everything gravitate to $HOME/.gnome2/.

Sun Dec 02 19:23:25 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel-util.[ch], foobar-widget.c: implement a utility for 'event
	  streching', so that we can accept clicks on the edge of the
	  screen for example in foobar, no matter how wide the border of the
	  panel/menubar is.

Sun Dec 02 15:11:31 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* foobar-widget.c: get rid of some deprecated menu_bar function usage

Sun Dec 02 14:52:39 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* foobar-widget.c: fix pixmap loading, do Applications/Actions
	  setup as from nils's proposal (sort of).  Still needs a lot of
	  work.

2001-12-01  Seth Nickell  <snickell@stanford.edu>

	* foobar-widget.c: (foobar_widget_instance_init):

	Change menu name to "Applications" per Nils' panel
	menu design.
	
	* menu.c: (image_menu_shown):

	Icons for upper most menus should be loaded first. Most users
	start reading from top to bottom. When you load icons
	from bottom to top scanning is essentially disrupted until
	all icons are loaded.
	
Sat Dec 01 22:44:28 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* menu.c: get rid of the large icon stuff, if we already have 
	  a GtkImage for the file we're looking for loaded, just use that,
	  makes the KDE screensaver menu icons load faster then a speeding
	  bullet (among others:).  Also fix the horizontal jump by directly
	  setting the empty image requisition.

Sat Dec 01 21:21:17 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* menu.c: removed a bit of the jumpiness effect due to menu icons,
	  there is a horizontal one left which I don't understand.  Make sure
	  foldres without an icon get the folder icon.  Only load icons
	  after the item has been shown, meaning that preloading menus won't
	  start hogging the disk, also when an item is hidden it's no
	  longer loaded.  Change behaviour to FILO so that most recently
	  shown items get loaded first.

2001-12-01  Seth Nickell  <snickell@stanford.edu>

	* menu.c: (load_icons_handler), (show_item_menu),
	(setup_full_menuitem_with_size), (start_favourites_menu),
	(create_menuitem), (create_menu_at_fr), (applet_menu_append),

	(create_desktop_menu), (add_distribution_submenu),
	(add_kde_submenu), (create_root_menu), (load_menu_applet),
	(load_menu_image_deferred):

	Make panel menus use GtkImage rather than GtkPixmap. Furthermore
	convert to using GtkImageMenuItem at the coercion of jrb. This
	does some weird things (note that the height of menu items changes
	pre and post image allocation) which I'll have to repair.

	Got rid of the fake icon stuff since (hypothetically) this should
	be handled by GtkImageMenuItem.
	
Fri Nov 30 17:34:01 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* *.[ch]: kill PanelOrientation and use GtkOrientation, Kill dialog

2001-11-30  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* panel-gconf.c, panel-gconf.h:
	Added panel_gconf_get_session_key () to return
	session ID based key. Probably not we will end 
	up using eventually, but will do for now

2001-11-29 Stephen Browne <stephen.browne@sun.com>

	* Makefile.am

	added PANELCONFIG_CFLAGS to includes to fix build 
	of gnome-panel-properties

2001-11-29 Stephen Browne <stephen.browne@sun.com>

	* Makefile.am

	Added gnome-panel-properties build target and 
	associated glade stuff.

	* gnome-panel-properties.c

	This is a work in progress but at least its started.
	Mostly ripped this out and started again.
	Now uses libglade and gconf.
	The GEGL Lives on.

2001-11-29  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* basep-widget.c, button-widget.c,  menu.c,  
	panel-widget.c,  panel_config_global.h,
	panelglobalconfig.schemas, session.c: 

	Changed some of the configuration around to be more 
	sensible. Removed titles on menus code forever. Fix
	bug where launchers/applets would move off the left 
	hand side of the screen.

2001-11-29  Glynn Foster <glynn.foster@sun.com>
	
	* panel-gconf.[ch]: Add some more convience methods.
	Not entirely sure if this is useful yet.

2001-11-29  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* applet.c: (applet_button_press): tidy.

2001-11-28  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* basep-widget.c: (basep_border_queue_recalc): use
          g_idle_add instead of gtk_idle_add and save a few
          stackframes.

	Add Categories field

2001-11-28  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* Makefile.am, panelglobalconfig.schema,

	I just copied *cough* libgnome.

2001-11-27  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* Makefile.am: cleanup enums and marshallers generation.

	* panel-marshal-main.c: remove.

2001-11-27  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	(create_launcher): remove duplicate, redundant call to
	gnome_program_locate_file.

Tue Nov 27 00:42:05 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Makefile.am, menu-rh.[ch], distribution.[ch]: whack the redhat
	  menu stuff.  Note this was the OLD redhat menu stuff which was
	  just plain crack.  Though this reduces the overall ugliness
	  quotient of the menu*.c files by quite a bit, but I'll live.

	* panel-utils.[ch], quick-desktop-reader.c, menu.c,
	  menu-properties.c, launcher.c: Make pixmap finding work better
	  also find kde icons from kde2 properly (well ... properly ...
	  somewhat properly).  Load last mapped first for fakes.  Fix
	  the gtk_menu_reposition hack to be shorter but just as evil.

2001-11-27  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* menu.c, panel.c: Revert Mark's reverts...Yay, commit war!

	s/g_signal_connect_object/g_signal_connect/swapped

	* quick-desktop-reader.c: (quick_desktop_item_load_uri): ditto.

	* menu.c: (fake_mapped_fake), (show_item_menu),
	(create_menu_at_fr): revert g_signal_connect_object changes
	back to gtk_signal_connect_object. Giving out warnings and not
	sure how to fix it.
	Use g_signal_handlers_disconnect_matched instead of
	g_signal_disconnect_by_func which doesn't exist.

	* panel-widget.c: (panel_widget_applet_event):
	reverse order of params in g_signal_lookup calls.

	* panel.c: (basep_pos_connect_signals): revert
	 g_signal_connect_object changes back to 
	 gtk_signal_connect_object. Giving out warnings and not sure
	 how to fix it.

2001-11-26  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	I see a glorious dream for the panel. Using no deprecated stuff
	for the 2.0 release. This brings us one step closer to that dream.
	Some more gtk_signal_* porting. Now there is only the weird stuff
	left that I don't know what to do with.
	
2001-11-26  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* launcher.c, session.c: Quick hack to get launchers on the panel
	again. Don't expect it to be working 100% of the time. We really
	need to get this stuff using gnome-vfs all over.

	More gtk_signal donkey work. The gtk_signal stuff that is left is 
	a) cruft that we're gonna lose b) stuff that I don't know the 
	GObject replacement for.

Mon Nov 26 00:57:16 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* applet.c, menu-properties.[ch], menu.[ch], panel.c, session.c:
	  get rid of the "." main menu parameter hack.  I feel sort of
	  sentimental removing this since this dates back from the days
	  when federico maintained the panel.  I don't know why it lived
	  on so long anyway :)

	* menu.c: remove the properties menu stuff, just about everyone
	  agreed it was quite a horrible UI

	* foobar-widget.c, menu.c, panel-util.[ch]: add
	  panel_is_program_in_path which is like g_find_program_in_path
	  but returns just a boolean

	* menu.h, session.c: remove some compatibility hacks dating to
	  some ancient 1.0 versions or whatnot.  We'll break config compat
	  anyway.

Sun Nov 25 20:07:06 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* launcher.c, menu.c, menu-fentry.[ch], main.c: remove the
	  merged menu hack since that's taken care of in the
	  vfolder-desktop-method nowdays

	* quick-desktop-reader.[ch], panel-util.[ch]: add sort_order
	  to quick desktop item and move the vfs helper routines to

2001-10-11  Alex Larsson  <alexl@redhat.com>

	* applet.c (applet_button_press):
	Don't return TRUE here, it makes the buttons not
	work. I'm not sure about the comment here in the old
