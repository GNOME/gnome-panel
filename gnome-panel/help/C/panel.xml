   <title>Panel Basics</title>
   <para>
    Using the GNOME Panel is very simple and will come easily to
    anyone who has used a graphical desktop environment.  This section
    will give you a basic introduction to help you get started, and
    the following sections will discuss the various panel objects and
    features in more detail.
   </para>

   <sect2 id="intropanel">
    <title>Introduction to Panel Objects</title>
    <para>
     The Panel can hold several types of objects.  The example Panel
     in  <xref linkend="examplepanelfig"> shows each type of Panel
     object. 
    </para>

    <para>
     This example Panel contains the following objects:
     <itemizedlist>  
      <listitem> 
       <formalpara>
        <title>Menus</title>
        <para> 
         <guilabel>Menus</guilabel> are lists of items, each of which
         either starts an application, executes a command, or is a
         sub-menu.  In the example Panel, the left-most
         icon after the arrow is a stylized footprint icon (the GNOME
         logo). This is the <guimenu>Main Menu</guimenu>, one of the
         most important objects in the Panel.  This menu provides
         access to almost all the applications, commands, and
         configuration options available in GNOME. The <guimenu>Main
         Menu</guimenu> is described in detail in <xref
         linkend="mainmenu">. The second icon shown is a folder, the
         default icon used for user <guilabel>Menus</guilabel>.  GNOME
         allows users to create their own <guilabel>Menus</guilabel>
         with personalized contents to use in addition to the
         <guimenu>Main Menu</guimenu>.  To open a
         <guimenu>Menu</guimenu>, just click on the icon with the left
         mouse button.  For more information on
         <guilabel>Menus</guilabel>, see <xref linkend="menus">.
        </para>
       </formalpara>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>  
       <formalpara>
        <title>Launchers</title>
        <para> 
         <guilabel>Launchers</guilabel> are buttons which either start
         an application or execute a command when you press them(click
         with the left mouse button).
         The third icon in the example Panel is a
         <guilabel>Launcher</guilabel> which starts the
         <application>Gnumeric</application> spreadsheet.  For more
         information on <guilabel>Launchers</guilabel>, see <xref
        linkend="launchers">.

      <listitem>  
       <formalpara>
        <title>Applets</title>
        <para> 
         <guilabel>Applets</guilabel> are applications which run inside
         a small part of the Panel. The fourth through eighth icons
         in the example Panel 
         are <guilabel>Applets</guilabel>. The first
         <guilabel>Applet</guilabel> shown is <application>GNOME
         Weather</application>, which periodically downloads the current
         weather conditions off the Web and displays the
         information. The second <guilabel>Applet</guilabel> is the
         <application>Drive Mount Applet</application>, which shows
         whether a disk (in this case, the floppy drive) is mounted and
         allows you to mount and unmount the drive with a single click
         of the mouse.  The third <guilabel>Applet</guilabel> shown is
         the <application>Quick Launch Applet</application>, which acts
         as a container for <guilabel>Launchers</guilabel>, but saves
         more space than placing your <guilabel>Launchers</guilabel>
         directly on the Panel. In the example shown the
         <application>Quick Launch Applet</application> contains six
         application <guilabel>Launchers</guilabel>.  Next is the 
         <guilabel>GNOME Desk Guide</guilabel>, which allows you to
         control multiple virtual desktops, each of which can have
         multiple screens.  You can move between desktops and screens
         by clicking with your left mouse button.  The final 
         <guilabel>Applet</guilabel> shown is the
         <guilabel>Tasklist</guilabel>, which allows you to control
         your windows in various ways, including changing the focus,
         iconifying windows, closing windows, and killing applications.
         The <guilabel>Tasklist</guilabel> shown is for a screen with
         only two windows, both of which are <application>Electric
         Eyes</application>.  For more information on
         <guilabel>Applets</guilabel>, see <xref linkend="applets">.

       <formalpara>
        <title>Drawers</title>
        <para> 
         <guilabel>Drawers</guilabel> are essentially extensions of the
         Panel which can be opened or closed.  They can hold anything
         the panel can.  The brown icon of a drawer in the example
         Panel is the default icon for
         <guilabel>Drawers</guilabel>, although any icon can be
         used. Click on the <guilabel>Drawer</guilabel> with the left
         mouse button to open or close it.  For more information on
         <guilabel>Drawers</guilabel>, see <xref linkend="drawers">.

       <formalpara>
        <title>Special Objects</title>
        <para> 
         <guilabel>Special Objects</guilabel> are items you can
         add to the Panel which perform functions which are generally
         not available through the other Panel objects. The last
         item in the example Panel is a <guilabel>Special
         Object</guilabel> called the <guibutton>Logout
         Button</guibutton>. Pressing this with the left mouse button
         begins the logout sequence to end 
         your GNOME session. For more
         information on <guilabel>Special Objects</guilabel>, see <xref

   <sect2 id="rightclick">
    <title>Right-click menu</title>
    <para>
     Clicking on any panel object with the right mouse button brings
     up the Panel object <guimenu>Pop-up Menu</guimenu>. This
     <guilabel>Menu</guilabel> contains 
     <guimenuitem>Remove from panel</guimenuitem> for removing the
     object from the panel, <guimenuitem>Move applet</guimenuitem> for
     moving objects within the Panel or between Panels, 
     the <guimenu>Panel Submenu</guimenu> described below, and 
     object-specific items.  For <guilabel>Drawers</guilabel>,
     <guilabel>Menus</guilabel>, and <guilabel>Launchers</guilabel>
      the only object-specific item is the
     <guimenuitem>Properties...</guimenuitem> item which allows you
     to customize the properties and settings of the object. For
     <guilabel>Applets</guilabel>, the
     <guimenu>Pop-up Menu</guimenu> will often contain
     <guimenuitem>About</guimenuitem> for viewing information about
     the <guilabel>Applet</guilabel> such as the author's name and the
     <guilabel>Applet</guilabel> version, 
     <guimenuitem>Help</guimenuitem> for viewing documentation about
     the <guilabel>Applet</guilabel>, and
     <guimenuitem>Properties</guimenuitem> for 
     configuring preferences and settings for the
     <guilabel>Applet</guilabel>.  <guilabel>Applets</guilabel> 
     often have other <guilabel>Applet</guilabel>-specific controls in the
     <guimenu>Pop-up Menu</guimenu>.
    </para>
    <para>
     The <guimenu>Panel Submenu</guimenu> allows you to <link
     linkend="panelmove">create and remove Panels</link> and <link
     linkend="appletadd">add objects</link> to the
     Panel.  It also allows you to modify the properties of the
     particular Panel of interest using the
     <guimenuitem>Properties</guimenuitem> menu item (see <xref
     linkend="panelproperties">) or the properties of all panels using
     <guimenuitem>Global Preferences...</guimenuitem> menu item (see <xref

    </para>
    <para>
     You can also right-click on the Panel itself. This will

     Pressing one of these arrows will hide the GNOME Panel by sliding
     it in the direction of the arrow pressed, so that the only
     part of the panel which remain visible is the
     <guibutton>Hide</guibutton> button itself.   Pressing it a second
     time will expand the Panel.
    </para>
    <para>
     The Panel can be configured to automatically hide when you are
     not using it and reappear when you move the mouse to the part of
     the screen where the Panel resides. This can be a helpful
     function if you are unable to run your system in a high
     resolution.  To learn how to have the Panel auto-hide, see <xref

     The default way of logging out is by using the
     <guilabel>Logout</guilabel> option, which ends your GNOME session
     but does not shut down the computer.  Depending on your system
     configuration, you may also have the <guilabel>Halt</guilabel>
     option, which shuts down the computer, and the
     <guilabel>Reboot</guilabel> option, which will reboot the
     computer.

  <para>
   Launchers are essentially buttons which reside in your panel and

   can use any icon and has a customized tooltip to display a message
   when the cursor is passed over the Launcher.
  </para>
  <para> 
      You can change a launcher properties, such as the icon it uses
      and its name, by right-clicking on a launcher and selecting
      <guimenuitem>Properties</guimenuitem> from the pop-up menu. This  
      brings up the <interface>Launcher properties dialog</interface>
      shown in <xref linkend="launcherpropsfig">. The same dialog is
      used when you create a new launcher (see <xref
      linkend="add">). Also, internally GNOME makes no distinction
      between menu items and launchers: these are just different
      presentations of the same thing. You can place any menu item on
      the panel, and it will show as a launcher. Therefore, all the
      information below applies equally to launchers and menu items.

  <para>
   Applets are GNOME applications which reside in the Panel. An

<!-- ###########  Drawers  ############## -->
 <sect1 id="drawers">
  <title>Drawers</title>
  <para>
   The simplest way of thinking about a Drawer is that it is a
   container to store things.  Typically one may use a Drawer to hold
   multiple launchers which are related to each other in some way,
   such as the various applications in GNOME Office. The Drawers in
   the GNOME Panel take this one step further by making a Drawer an
   actual extension of the Panel itself.  Thus, a Drawer is a
   collapsible branch of an existing Panel.  It can contain anything
   that a Panel can, including Launchers, Applets, and other Drawers.
  </para>

  <para>
   Once you have placed a Drawer on the Panel, you may click on it to
   "open" the Drawer, revealing its contents.   You may then add items
   to the Drawer in the same way you would add items to the panel,
   right clicking on the end of the drawer with the arrow.  You can
   close the Drawer by clicking on its icon again or by clicking on
   the arrow at its end.
  </para>
  <para>
   You can configure a Drawer's properties by right clicking on the
   Drawer's icon and selecting
   <guimenuitem>Properties</guimenuitem>. This brings up the
   <interface>Drawer Properties Dialog</interface>. Here you can
   select the icon used for the drawer by clicking on the icon. A
   tooltip may be entered by typing in the
   <guilabel>Tooltip/Name</guilabel> entry. This tooltip will be
   displayed whenever the mouse is moved over the Drawer to remind you
   what is inside.  One may also select whether the <guibutton>hide
   button</guibutton> and arrow are displayed at the end of the
   drawer.

    The Status Dock is a Panel object which can hold Status Docklets -
    small windows which applications place in the Status Dock to
    provide status information.  Status Docklets can also be used to
    control the application. Essentially, Docklets are small (both in
    size and in complexity) applets.   GNOME currently does not have many
    applications which place Status Docklets in the Status Dock.
    However, GNOME's Status Dock is compatible with that on the K
    Desktop Environment (KDE), so KDE applications, such as
    <application>kscd</application>, may place Status Docklets in
    GNOME's Status Dock.  Future versions of GNOME applications will
    make use of this recently added Panel object.

	be added to the panel as an application launcher. GNOME also
	contains a number of applets that can be added to the panel,
	ranging from <application>Printer Applet</application>, which
	prints a file which you drag and drop onto this applet, to
	<application>Wanda the Fish</application>. If these are not

	      </para>
	    <para> Advanced users can also create new menus
	      manually. To do so, you need to know that internally,
	      GNOME represents a menu by a directory, with menu items
	      presented by files of special type
	      (<filename>.desktop</filename> files &mdash; these files
	      also represent the application launchers), and submenus
	      presented by directories. For example, the
	      <guimenu>Favorites</guimenu> menu corresponds to the
	      directory <filename>~/.gnome/apps</filename> (where
	      <filename>~</filename> denotes your home directory), and
	      the <guimenu>Programs</guimenu> menu corresponds to the
	      directory
	      <filename>/usr/share/gnome/apps</filename>. Thus, you
	      can create a new directory, using the GNOME File
	      Manager, drag and drop there any
	      <filename>.desktop</filename> files from any other
	      directories you might have (for example, from
	      <filename>/usr/share/gnome/apps</filename>) or from the
	      desktop, and then drag and drop this directory from the
	      File Manager window to the panel. This will add this
	      directory as a menu to the panel.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      After you have added a menu to the panel using any of
	      the methods described above, you can modify its
	      properties (for example, add new items to this menu or

      This tab also allows you to configure some global key
      bindings. At the moment, you can define key bindings for Main
      Menu and for Run Command dialog. For example, if you are using
      a standard PC keyboard, you can bind the <keycap>Menu</keycap> key
      (this key is usually located to the left of the space bar and
      labelled with a picture of a menu) to the Main Menu, so that
      pressing this key will bring up the Main Menu; similarly, the
      common key binding for the Run command dialog is the so-called
      <keycap>Windows</keycap> key (called so because on most PC
      keyboards this key is indeed labelled with a flying window).  To
      change the key bound to Main Menu or to the Run Dialog, you can

	  If you have problems with using <keycap>Menu</keycap> or

	  <programlisting>

<sect1 id="panelbugs">

    <title>Current bugs and limitations</title>
    <para>
      Most of the things here are not really bugs; rather, they
      describe situations when the Panel's behavior is not what you
      would expect.  
    </para>  

    <para> You can not place an
      ordinary file or directory on the Panel. If you try to drag and
      drop a file from the File Manager window to the panel, it won't
      work. The only type of file that can
      be placed on the Panel are <filename>.desktop</filename> files,
      which describe launchers; any directory dropped on the panel
      will be interpreted as a menu &mdash; that is, all the files
      other than <filename>.desktop</filename> files will be ignored.
    </para>

    <para> Editing menus other than the Main menu is rather
      confusing. <application>Menu Editor</application> at the moment
      can not be used for this, and
      <guimenuitem>Properties</guimenuitem> item of the right-click
      menu is not too helpful either - for example, it doesn't allow
      one to change menu's icon (see <xref linkend="menusconf"> for
      instructions for doing this). This will be improved in the next
      release.
    </para>

    <para> The Main menu which you get by pressing the
      <keycap>Menu</keycap> key on the keyboard or, by right-clicking
      on the panel itself, and the main menu you get by clicking on
      the foot icon are configured separately. The reason is that you
      can have several <guimenu>Main Menu</guimenu> buttons on
      different panels.
    </para>

    <para>
     The <guibutton>Screen Lock</guibutton> button does not lock the
     screen if "No Screensaver" is set in the Control Center.
    </para>

    <para> 
      The only way of changing Panel type (Edge, Aligned, etc.) is by
      choosing <menuchoice>
       <guisubmenu>Properties</guisubmenu>
       <guisubmenu>Type</guisubmenu> 
      </menuchoice> from the <guimenu>Panel</guimenu> menu: you can
      not change Panel type in <interface>Panel Properties</interface>
      dialog. Conversely, <menuchoice>
       <guisubmenu>Properties</guisubmenu>
       <guisubmenu>Background type</guisubmenu> 
      </menuchoice>   allows you to change the background type
      (Pixmap/Color/Standard), but not to choose the actual color or
      image to use.
