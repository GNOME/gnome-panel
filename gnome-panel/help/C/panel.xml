    The GNOME Panel is the heart of the GNOME user interface and acts
    as a repository for applications launchers, applets(applications
    which run entirely within the panel), and menus.  The Panel was
    designed to be highly configurable.  You can easily customize its
    contents, behavior, and  appearance to suite your personal needs
    and preferences.  You can even have multiple panels, each with its
    own appearance, properties, and contents.  This flexibility allows
    you to easily create a comfortable and efficient personalized
    desktop environment.
   </para>

<!-- ########### Panel Basics  ############## -->
  <sect1 id="panelbasic"> 
  <title>Panel Basics</title>
   <para>
    Using the GNOME Panel is very simple and will come easily to
    anyone who has used a graphical desktop environment.  This section
    will give you a basic introduction to help you get started, and
    the following sections will discuss the various panel contents and
    features in more detail.
   </para>

   <sect2 id="expanel">
    <title>An Example Panel</title>

    <para>
     The panel can hold several types of objects. Most important are:
1) <guilabel>application launchers</guilabel> &mdash; buttons which
start an application when clicked with the mouse, 2)
<guilabel>applets</guilabel> &mdash; applications which run inside of
the panel, displaying information for the user, 3)
<guilabel>menus</guilabel> &mdash; heirarchical lists of applications.  Each
of these will be described in detail in the following sections.
</para>

    <para>For now, a simple example of each panel object will be
     sufficient to get started. The example panel shown below shows
     each type of panel object. (YES, I KNOW - WE NEED A DIFFERENT
     SCREENSHOT) ... The tiger head icon is a launcher, which starts
     the ... program when clicked.  The square gray box
     with red and green charts in it is the
     <application>rp3</application> applet, which activates or ends
     modem connections, and also plots the data transfer rate when the
     modem connection is active.  The ... menu...  The ... folder ...

     You may decide that you want the Panel to hide on its own when you are not
     using it. This can be a helpful function if you are unable to run your
     system in a high resolution.  You can find out how to auto hide
     the Panel in

      The (foot) seen towards the left end of the example panel is the
      <guibutton>Main Menu</guibutton>...
      To start using any pre-loaded application click on the
      <guibutton>Main Menu Button</guibutton>. The Main Menu has the
      picture of the stylized foot and on first use is on the bottom
      left of the screen. You should release the mouse after pressing
      the <guibutton>Main Menu</guibutton> button so that you can take
      advantage of other mouse-activated features in the Main Menu
      such as right mouse clicks and drag and drop from the menu.

     The Main Menu is the starting point for all of the applications
     on your system. Later in this manual you will learn how to
     customize the Main Menu to suit your work environment, but for
     now you can use the menu that is established when you install
     GNOME. The Main Menu works like any other menu you might have
     used in other graphical desktop environments. Simply press the
     <guibutton>Main Menu</guibutton> Button and select from the menu
     that pops up from the button.

   <sect2 id="loggingout">
    <title>Logging Out</title>
    <para>
     This button is used to log out of GNOME; it provides the same
     functionality as the <guimenuitem>Logout</guimenuitem> command of
     the mian menu.  Pressing this button will show the
     <interface>Logout dialog</interface>, which will ask you whether
     or not you really want to log out. It also provides you with
     different methods of quitting GNOME.
    </para>
    <para>
     You have three choices on how to quit GNOME. You may
     <guilabel>Logout</guilabel> which will simply take you to a
     terminal; <guilabel>Halt</guilabel>, which will shut down the
     whole system; or <guilabel>Reboot</guilabel>, which will reboot
     the whole system.
    </para>
    <para>
     If you do not want to log out you may press the
     <guibutton>No</guibutton> button and you will be returned to your

      If you are running a window manager that is GNOME compliant, the

      end that window manager yourself.

	  To move any object on the panel to a different location,
	  just drag it with the middle mouse button to the desired
	  place, or right-click on it and choose <guimenuitem>Move
	  applet</guimenuitem>. If in the course of this movement it
	  hits other objects, the behaviour depends on the global
	  preferences you set (see <xref linkend="??">): the object you are
	  moving can switch places with other objects, "push" all
	  objects it meets, or "jump" over all other objects without
	  disturbing them. You can also overrun the default behaviour
	  by holding <keycap>Shift</keycap> button (which causes
	  "pushing") or <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> (causes "switching
	  places") button while dragging.
	</para>
      </sect2>
	<sect2 id="remove">

	    To remove an object from the panel, right-click on it and

	    </para>
	</sect2>
	<sect2 id="add"> 
	  <title>Adding objects to the panel</title> 

	  <para> There are several ways to add an object to the
	  panel. One of the possible ways is to right-click on the
	  panel and choose <guimenuitem>Add to panel</guimenuitem>
	  command from the <guimenu>Panel</guimenu> menu. This shows a
	  menu of all possible objects you can add to the
	  panel. Choosing <guimenuitem>Applet</guimenuitem> will give
	  you further menu from which you can select any applet you
	  like.  Similarly, choosing <guimenuitem>Menu</guimenuitem>
	  gives you a choice of the Main menuju, program menu, and
	  favorites menu. If you choose
	  <guimenuitem>launcher</guimenuitem>, you will be presented
	  the <interface>Create Launcher dialog</interface>, shown
	  below.  In this dialog you should enter a name for your
	  launcher, a comment, the command line to launch the
	  application, and define the application type.  You may also
	  press the icon button and choose an icon to represent the
	  application from the icon picker. If no icon is chosen a
	  default icon will be used.  This dialog has a built-in help
	  which explains its usage in detail.

     </screenshot>
     </figure>
	  <para>
	  You can also utilize drag and drop to add  objects to the
	  panel. For example, you can drag any application launcher
	  you have on the desktop to the panel; similarly, you can
	  drag a folder from the GNOME File Manager window to the
	  panel. Moreover, you can also drag any item from  the Main
	  menu or its submenu  to
	  the panel (it will appear as an application launcher). Even
	  a whole submenu can be dragged to a panel; to do so, you
	  must drag the menu title (at the top of the menu). 
	    </para>


	  <para> Yet one more method of adding an application launcher
	    to the Panel is right mouse click on an application menu
	    item. You will be given another menu selection which
	    contains <guimenuitem>Add this launcher to
	    Panel</guimenuitem>.  If you select this menu item it will
	    automatically add a launcher for that application to the
	    Panel in which you invoked the Main Menu.  At this point
	    you may right mouse click on the launcher and select the
	    <guimenuitem>Properties</guimenuitem> menu item to change
	    any options for that launcher.

    A Drawer is simply a small menu-like button that sits on your
    panel that groups application  launchers together in one place; it
    is very much like a menu, but instead of showing its contents as
    commands, it shows them as launcher buttons.  Once you have placed
    a Drawer on the Panel you may click on it to raise the menu of
    applications and click again to lower them.
   </para>
   <para>
    (I'M NOT SURE THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO EXPLAIN THINGS.  First,
    drawers can hold applets too.  They can hold other drawers. They
    can hold menus.  Hmm.  I think we should say that a drawer is just
    a "branch" of panel, which can contain anything a panel can hold.)
