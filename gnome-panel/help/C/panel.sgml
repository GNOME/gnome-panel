<!-- ########### Panel Basics  ############## --> <sect1
  id="panelbasic">  <title>Panel Basics</title>
   <para>
    Using the GNOME Panel is very simple and will come easily to
    anyone who has used a graphical desktop environment.  This section
    will give you a basic introduction to help you get started, and
    the following sections will discuss the various panel contents and
    features in more detail.
   </para>

   <sect2 id="expanel">
    <title>An Example Panel</title>

      <para>
	The panel can hold several types of objects. Most important of
	them are <guilabel>application launchers</guilabel> &mdash;
	buttons which start an application when clicked with the
	mouse, <guilabel>applets</guilabel> &mdash; applications which
	run inside of the panel, displaying information for the user,
	and <guilabel>menus</guilabel> &mdash;.  Each of these types
	is described in detail in the following sections. You can
	easily add, move, or remove panel objects &mdash; see <xref
	linkend="appletadd">.
      </para>
      <para> To use any of these objects, all you have to do is to
      click on it with the left mouse button. This will produce the
      default action for this object: for menus, bring up the menu;
      for application launchers, launch the corresponding application,
      for applets, it depends on the applet: some of them do nothing
      (for example, the clock applet); others will execute some
      commands when clicked.  </para>

    <para>For now, a simple example of each panel object will be
     sufficient to get started. The example panel shown below shows
     each type of panel object. (YES, I KNOW - WE NEED A DIFFERENT
     SCREENSHOT).
    </para>

       srccredit="muet">

     </screenshot>
    </figure>
      <para> Most important of all items shown here is the
     <guimenu>Main Menu</guimenu>, shown by the stylized footprint
     icon in the left side of the panel. This menu provides you access
     to almost all you can do with GNOME &mdash; all the applications,
     configuration tools,  command line prompt,
     <guimenuitem>Logout</guimenuitem> and <guimenuitem>Lock
     Screen</guimenuitem> commands, and much more.  The main menu is
     described in detail in <xref linkend="mainmenu">.
      </para>
      <para>
 ... The tiger head icon is a launcher, which starts the ... program
     when clicked.  The square gray box with red and green charts in
     it is the <application>rp3</application> applet, which activates
     or ends modem connections, and also plots the data transfer rate
     when the modem connection is active.  PAGER
      </para>
   </sect2>

 
   <sect2 id="rightclick">
    <title>Right-click menu</title>
    <para>
     Clicking on any panel object with the right mouse button brings
     up the <guimenu>pop-up</guimenu>  menu. This menu contains
     <guimenuitem>Remove from panel</guimenuitem> for removing the
     object from the panel, <guimenuitem>Move applet</guimenuitem> for
     moving objects within the Panel, the <guimenu>Panel</guimenu>
     menu described below, and object-specific items.  For Drawers,
     Menus, and Launchers the only object-specific item is
     a <guimenuitem>Properties...</guimenuitem> item which allows you
     to customize the properties and settings of the object. For Applets, the
     <guimenu>pop-up</guimenu> menu will often contain
     <guimenuitem>About</guimenuitem> for viewing information about
     the Applet such as the author's name and the Applet version,
     <guimenuitem>Help</guimenuitem> for viewing documentation about
     the Applet, and <guimenuitem>Properties</guimenuitem> for
     configuring preferences and settings for the Applet.  Applets
     often have other Applet-specific controls in the
     <guimenu>pop-up</guimenu> menu.
    </para>
    <para>
     The <guimenu>Panel</guimenu> menu allows you to create and remove
     Panels and add objects to the Panel.  It also allows you to
     modify the properties of the particular Panel of interest using
     <guimenuitem>Properties</guimenuitem> (see <xref
     linkend="panelproperties">) or the properties of all panels using
     <guimenuitem>Global Preferences...</guimenuitem>(see <xref
     linkend="globalpanelprefs">).
    </para>
    <para>
     You can also right-click on the panel itself. This will
     bring up the <link linkend="mainmenu"><guimenu>Main
     Menu</guimenu></link>. In particular, this menu also contains the
     <guimenu>Panel</guimenu> menu described above.

     The left and right arrow icons seen at either end of the example
     panel are used to hide the panel. These arrows are shown in the
     following figure.

    </para>
    <para>
     Pressing one of these arrows will hide the GNOME Panel by sliding
     it in the direction of the arrow pressed.  Pressing it a second
     time will expand the Panel.
    </para>
    <para>
     The Panel can be configured to automatically hide when you are
     not using it and reappear when you move the mouse to the part of
     the screen where the Panel resides. This can be a helpful
     function if you are unable to run your system in a high
     resolution.  To learn how to have the Panel auto-hide, see <xref
     linkend="panelproperties">.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2 id="loggingout">
    <title>Logging Out</title>
    <para>
     To log out of GNOME, right click on either end of the Panel and
     select <guimenuitem>Log out</guimenuitem>. This will bring up the
     Logout Dialog seen below.
    </para>

    <para>
     If you would like to save your current setup, select the
     <guilabel>Save current setup</guilabel> checkbox. This will save
     any GNOME programs you have open and configuration changes you
     may have made in the Control Center.
    </para>
    <para>
     The default way of logging out is by using the
     <guilabel>Logout</guilabel> option, which ends your GNOME session
     but does not shut down the computer.  Depending on your system
     configuration, you may also have the <guilabel>Halt</guilabel>
     option, which shuts down the computer, and the
     <guilabel>Reboot</guilabel> option, which will reboot the
     computer.
    </para>
    <note>   <title>Note for advanced users</title>  <para>   The
     <guilabel>Halt</guilabel> and <guilabel>Reboot</guilabel> choices
     will only be shown if you have the permission to execute the
     command <command>/usr/bin/shutdown</command>.
     </para>
    </note>
    <para>
     If you do not want to log out, press the
     <guibutton>No</guibutton> button and you will be returned to your
     GNOME session. Otherwise press the <guibutton>Yes</guibutton>
     button to log out.
    </para>
    <note>
     <title>Logging Out and Window Managers</title>
     <para>
      If you are running a window manager that is GNOME compliant, the
      logout feature will quit the window manager as well as GNOME. If
      you are running a non-compliant window manager you will have to
      quit the window manager yourself.
     </para>
    </note>
    <para>
     You can disable the Logout Dialog so that pressing the logout
     button will end your GNOME session without asking any
     questions. To do so, start GNOME control center (<menuchoice>
     <guisubmenu>Startup programs</guisubmenu> </menuchoice>) and
     uncheck the button <guilabel>Prompt on logout</guilabel>. You may
     also control whether changes to your session are automatically
     saved using the <guilabel>Automatically save changes to
     session</guilabel> button.
    </para>
   </sect2>
   <sect2 id="lockscreen">
    <title>Locking the Screen</title>
    <para>
     Sometimes you may want to leave your computer with GNOME running
     and not allow others to use or view your GNOME session.  GNOME
     allows you to do this by locking the screen, requiring a password
     to unlock it. To lock your GNOME session, right click on either
     end of a Panel and select <guimenuitem>Lock screen</guimenuitem>.
    </para>
    <note>
     <title>Screensavers and The Lock Button</title>
     <para>
      The <guibutton>Lock Button</guibutton> uses a feature of the
      <application>xscreensaver</application> program. This is the same
      program that the Control Center uses to set your screensaver. In
      order for the <guibutton>Lock Button</guibutton> to work
      properly, you must have a screensaver enabled in the Control
      Center.

      <indexterm id="idx-a3">  <primary>Main Menu</primary>
     </indexterm>
      The footprint icon seen towards the left end of the example
      panel is the <guibutton>Main Menu</guibutton> (yes, you guessed
      right, it is the footprint of the gnome). This menu provides you
      access to almost all you can do with GNOME &mdash; all the
      applications, configuration tools, command line prompt,
      <guimenuitem>Logout</guimenuitem> and <guimenuitem>Lock
      Screen</guimenuitem> commands, and much more.  To access any of
      its items, click on the <guibutton>Main Menu
      Button</guibutton>. You should release the mouse after pressing
      the <guibutton>Main Menu</guibutton> button so that you can take
      advantage of other mouse-activated features in the Main Menu
      such as right mouse clicks and drag and drop from the menu.

      <title> Components of the main menu</title>

      <para>
	The main component of the Main Menu is the
	<guimenu>Programs</guimenu> menu, which contains a list of
	preconfigured menu items. Here you will find all the GNOME
	applications, from <application>Gnumeric</application>
	spreadsheet to <application>Kanji terminal</application>, as
	well as quite a few non-Gnome ones, such as
	<application>Netscape</application> browser and
	<application>emacs</application> text editor.
	<guimenu>Programs</guimenu> menu also contains commands
	<guimenuitem>File manager</guimenuitem>, which launches the
	GNOME file manager, <guimenuitem>Run program</guimenuitem>,
	which gives you the command line prompt where you can enter
	any command, and <guimenuitem>Help</guimenuitem>, which
	launches the GNOME help browser. GNOME help browser gives you
	an easy access to all the documentation installed on your
	system &mdash; not only GNOME documentation (Users guide,
	application manuals, &hellip;), but also all other types of
	documentation (man pages, info pages).
      </para>


      <para> In addition to the <guimenu>Programs</guimenu>,  the main

 <sect1 id="launchers">
  <title>Launchers</title>
  <para>
   Launchers are essentially buttons which reside in your panel and
   start an application or execute a command when clicked.  A launcher
   can use any icon and has a customized tooltip to display a message
   when the cursor is passed over the Launcher.

<!-- ###########  Applets  ############## -->
 <sect1 id="applets">
  <title>Applets</title>
  <para>
   Applets are GNOME applications which reside in the Panel. An
   Applet's appearance typically reveals the state of the Applet or
   other information. Applets often have buttons, sliders, entries, or
   other methods to allow you to control their behavior.

  </figure>
  <para>
   Some example Applets are shown above.  At the very left is  the
   <application>Sound Monitor Applet</application>, which displays
   the current volume of sound being played and allows us to control
   various sound features.  Second is the <application>Mixer
   Applet</application>, which allows us to turn on/off sound and
   control its volume by clicking on applet.  This is followed by the
   <application>Battery Power Applet</application>, useful for
   monitoring the battery on a laptop. The fourth applet is the
   <application>GTCD Applet</application>, a CD player which has all
   its controls available in the applet and displays the track and
   time. The next applet is the <application>Drive Mount
   Applet</application>, used to mount and unmount drives with a
   single click of the mouse. The last applet shown is an analog
   clock, displaying the current time.
  </para>
  <para>
   GNOME has many useful applets.  Just right click on your Panel and
   add some applets to your panel to find out what is available and
   which ones are best for you.

<!-- ###########  Drawers  ############## -->
 <sect1 id="drawers">
  <title>Drawers</title>
  <para>
   The simplest way of thinking about a Drawer is that it is a
   container to store things.  Typically one may use a Drawer to hold
   multiple launchers which are related to each other in some way,
   such as the various applications in GNOME Office. The Drawers in
   the GNOME Panel take this one step further by making a Drawer an
   actual extension of the Panel itself.  Thus, a Drawer is a
   collapsible branch of an existing Panel.  It can contain anything
   that a Panel can, including Launchers, Applets, and other Drawers.
  </para>

  </figure>
  <para>
   Once you have placed a Drawer on the Panel, you may click on it to
   "open" the Drawer, revealing its contents.   You may then add items
   to the Drawer in the same way you would add items to the panel,
   right clicking on the end of the drawer with the arrow.  You can
   close the Drawer by clicking on its icon again or by clicking on
   the arrow at its end.
  </para>
  <para>
   You can configure a Drawer's properties by right clicking on the
   Drawer's icon and selecting
   <guimenuitem>Properties</guimenuitem>. This brings up the Drawer
   Properties Dialog. Here you can select the icon used for the drawer
   by clicking on the icon. A tooltip may be entered by typing in the
   <guilabel>Tooltip/Name</guilabel> entry. This tooltip will be
   displayed whenever the mouse is moved over the Drawer to remind you
   what is inside.  One may also select whether the <guibutton>hide
   button</guibutton> and arrow are displayed at the end of the drawer.

   <para>
    The <guibutton>Lock Button</guibutton> is a Panel button which
    begins a screensaver which locks the screen. In order to remove
    the screensaver and access the GNOME session again, you must
    supply your password.  This is typically used when you must leave
    your computer for a while and do not want to log out or allow
    other people to use your computer. To lock your screen, simply
    click on the <guibutton>Lock Button</guibutton>.

  <sect2 id="swallowedapps">
   <title>Swallowed Applications</title>
   <para>
    The GNOME Panel allows you to run applications which are not
    Applets inside the Panel as if they were Applets.  Applications
    which you pull into the Panel, even though they are not GNOME
    Applets are called "swallowed applications".  Applications do not
    have to be GNOME-compliant to be swallowed.  In general, the only
    constraints for swallowing an application are that the application
    must be small enough to fit in your panel and you must know the
    title of the window you would like to swallow.  In many cases, the
    application can be automatically shrank to fit in the Panel, as
    specified in the Create Swallowed Application Dialog.

   <para>
    The "Title of application to swallow" is the window title,
    typically displayed on the top left edge of the window. (Note that
    the window title is case sensitive.) The width
    and height determine the size of the swallowed application in the
    panel in pixels.  The
    optional "Command" entry is used to execute a command before
    swallowing the application.  This can be used to start an
    application which you want the Panel to swallow.

  <sect2 id="statusdock">
   <title>Status Dock</title>
   <para>
    The Status Dock is a Panel object which can hold Status Docklets -
    small windows which applications place in the Status Dock to
    provide status information.  Status Docklets can also be used to
    control the application.  GNOME currently does not have many
    applications which place Status Docklets in the Status Dock.
    However, GNOME's Status Dock is compatible with that on KDE, so
    KDE applications (eg: kscd) may place Status Docklets in GNOME's
    Status Dock.  Future versions of GNOME applications will make use
    of this recently added Panel object.

	    <para> Advanced users can also create new menus

	      (<filename>.desktop</filename> files &mdash; these files
	      also represent the application launchers), and submenus
	      presented by directories. For example, the
	      <guimenu>Favorites</guimenu> menu corresponds to the
	      directory <filename>~/.gnome/apps</filename> (where
	      <filename>~</filename> denotes your home directory), and
	      the <guimenu>Programs</guimenu> menu corresponds to the
	      directory
	      <filename>/usr/share/gnome/apps</filename>. Thus, you
	      can create a new directory, using the GNOME File
	      Manager, drag and drop there any
	      <filename>.desktop</filename> files from any other
	      directories you might have (for example, from
	      <filename>/usr/share/gnome/apps</filename>) or from the
	      desktop, and then drag and drop this directory from the
	      File Manager window to the panel. This will add this
	      directory as a menu to the panel.

	    <para>
	      After you have added a menu to the panel using any of

    <para>
      Most of the things here are not really bugs; rather, they
      describe situations when the Panel's behaviour is not what you
      would expect.  </para>  <para>  First of all: you can't place an
      ordinary file or directory on the panel. If you try to drag and
      drop a file from the File Manager window to the panel, it won't
      work, and similarly for panels. The only type of file that can
      be placed on the panel are <filename>.desktop</filename> files,
      which describe launchers; any directory dropped on the panel
      will be inetrpreted as a menu &mdash; that is, all the files
      other than <filename>.desktop</filename> files will be ignored.
      </para>
    <para> Editing menus other than the Main menu is rather
      confusing. <application>Menu Editor</application> at the moment
      can not be used for this, and
      <guimenuitem>Properties</guimenuitem> item of the right-click
      menu is not too helpful either - for example, it doesn't allow
      one to change menu's icon (see <xref linkend="menusconf"> for
      instructions for doing this). This will be improved in the next
      release.
    </para>

    <para> The Main menu which you get by pressing the
      <keycap>Menu</keycap> key on the keyboard does not reflect the
      preference changes you did to the <guimenu>main menu</guimenu>
      on the panel. The reason is that you can have several
      <guimenu>Main Menu</guimenu> buttons on different panels.
    </para>

    <para>
     The <guibutton>Screen Lock</guibutton> button does not lock the
     screen if "No Screensaver" is set in the Control Center.
    </para>
