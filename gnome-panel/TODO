Things to do on the panel, in no particular order:

1.2/1.4 items

[ Hmmmm ... needs some thought ]
* RootApplication dentry type support.  These would be items to run other apps
  as root.  This would require pam support of course.  So for things like
  GnoRPM you could have the normal Application dentry and a RootApplication
  dentry which would launch it in a mode where it would ask for password and
  run as root.  This would only be activated if "root application support"
  was toggled on somewhere (global prefs I guess).  This is high priority
  [Taken: George]

* make vertical explicit hide with a thin long button along the edge of the
  panel rather then on the sides. (the motion would be like it is in
  autohide.) Though I guess the current should be default as it's less
  wastefull for space.

* add a way to set up a custom icon for a menu button instead of using the
  one specified in the menu itself

* export more functionality through the CORBA interface, eventually I think
  we should have a per panel interface so that the panels could be
  manipulated through corba directly, we especially need to export a way to
  launch external applets and to add the internal ones, we can also have
  things to move panels, and to change their background

Vertigo items

* Bonobo the whole bit

* tabbed panels

* add a way to do drawers where it would be just a thin button on the side
  of a launcher, like it is in say os/2 or cde (it would not be the default
  mode, but an option)

* strech hint for applets so that the panel can optionally strech applets if
  it has the space and shrink em down again once it needs the space again
