This is the new 2.0 TODO list for panel hacking. Please fill in as appropriate.

+ Fix up schema files for panels on small, medium and large screens according to the 
  Usability Team's wishes [don't know what they are yet].
+ Create schema files for panel items on small, medium and large screens. Nils Pedersen 
  <n.p@sun.com> is already working on this.
+ Implement default and user-defined panel names, to aid accessibility.
+ Implement a New/Delete/Edit panel profile dialog.
+ Implement gconf notifies on all profile gconf keys so that if another panel instance 
  is running the same profile, then changing one setup will result in changing the other.
+ Make all saving instant apply, and remove the need for panel timeouts.
+ Check that session manager is handling the saving of --profile=some_profile properly.
+ Move all the construct/new functions to less arguments and gobject properties.
