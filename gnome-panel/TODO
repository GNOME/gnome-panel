Things to do on the panel, in no particular order:

* Use gdk-pixbuf for icons (button-widget) and do antialising
  (maybe optionally)

* save in state the torn off menus

* make non-dymanic menus also be tearable (pinnable)

* global panel properties in a capplet??? maybe???

* make vertical explicit hide with a thin long button along the edge of the
  panel rather then on the sides. (the motion would be like it is in
  autohide.) Though I guess the current should be default as it's less
  wastefull for space.

* finish status dock applet (win95/kde like docking) (Almost there)
