Things to do on the panel, in no particular order:

* save in state the torn off menus

* make vertical explicit hide with a thin long button along the edge of the
  panel rather then on the sides. (the motion would be like it is in
  autohide.) Though I guess the current should be default as it's less
  wastefull for space.

* support KDE docklets in the status applet

* add a way to set up a custom icon for a menu button instead of using the
  one specified in the menu itself

* do properties dialog for the floating panel (Taken: Jacob)

* tabbed panels

* add streching of a background pixmap completely over the panel

Stuff for post-GNOME 2.0:

* CORBA sevice for menus, support for remote menus and put menu UI into
  gnome-libs
