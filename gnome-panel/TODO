Things to do on the panel, in no particular order:

1.2/1.4 items

* When recheck all TryExec each time a menu is shown, or perhaps in background.

* Configuration boxes take effect immediately, no apply

[ Hmmmm ... needs some thought ]
* RootApplication dentry type support.  These would be items to run other apps
  as root.  This would require pam support of course.  So for things like
  GnoRPM you could have the normal Application dentry and a RootApplication
  dentry which would launch it in a mode where it would ask for password and
  run as root.  This would only be activated if "root application support"
  was toggled on somewhere (global prefs I guess).  This is high priority

Vertigo/2.0 items

* Bonobo the whole bit, that is:  Make the whole thing bonobo components, to
  allow even customization of the panel from outside.  Also the applets would become
  bonobo controls.

* GConf/GnoP using configuration boxes

* tabbed panels

* add a way to do drawers where it would be just a thin button on the side
  of a launcher, like it is in say os/2 or cde (it would not be the default
  mode, but an option)

* strech hint for applets so that the panel can optionally strech applets if
  it has the space and shrink em down again once it needs the space again

* make vertical explicit hide with a thin long button along the edge of the
  panel rather then on the sides. (the motion would be like it is in
  autohide.) Though I guess the current should be default as it's less
  wastefull for space.
