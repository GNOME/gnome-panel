Things to do on the panel, in no particular order:

1.4 items

* Control nautilus from the foobar desktop menu.  Layout is in gconf, so
  use gconf-tool there

[ Hmmmm ... needs some thought ]
* RootApplication dentry type support.  These would be items to run other apps
  as root.  This would require pam support of course.  So for things like
  GnoRPM you could have the normal Application dentry and a RootApplication
  dentry which would launch it in a mode where it would ask for password and
  run as root.  This would only be activated if "root application support"
  was toggled on somewhere (global prefs I guess).  This is high priority

* Perhaps the default folder icon should use the nautilus default folder icon,
  if it is set, so that it matches the theme.  Low priority, but perhaps would
  be nice.

Vertigo/2.0 items

* Make menu draggable, there is a problem, since the button grabs the pointer,
  and thus makes the menu button non-dragable (the drag will never trigger),
  This is a very low priority thing.

* Tasklist panel that works sort of like BeOS deskbar or whatever that's called
  or like win95 taskbar, with all the hiding etc... [ Probably NOT!,
  the current tasklist applet can work this way sort of ona  vertical panel ]

* Bonobo the whole bit, that is:  Make the whole thing bonobo components, to
  allow even customization of the panel from outside.  Also the applets would
  become bonobo controls.

* GConf/PonG using configuration boxes

* tabbed panels, these could be done in a variety of ways, such as a
  rotating block, real tabs, scrolling

* add a way to do drawers where it would be just a thin button on the side
  of a launcher, like it is in say os/2 or cde (it would not be the default
  mode, but an option)

* strech hint for applets so that the panel can optionally strech applets if
  it has the space and shrink em down again once it needs the space again

* make vertical explicit hide with a thin long button along the edge of the
  panel rather then on the sides. (the motion would be like it is in
  autohide.) Though I guess the current should be default as it's less
  wastefull for space.

* full panel collision avoidance, allow multiple panels in the same location
  on the edge and stack em, etc...
