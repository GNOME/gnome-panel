* Toplevel widget
    + need a resizing variant of animations for drawers

* GConf stuff
    + detect read-only keys
    + use our own keybindings directory for toplevel bindings
    + use_custom_key setting for drawers

* Properties dialog
   + properties dialog for drawers
   + allow changing the tiling/scaling/rotating settings
   + figure out what to do about setting the transparency color

* Fix everything in FIXME_FOR_NEW_CONFIG and FIXME_FOR_NEW_TOPLEVEL

* I've messed up launchers methinks. Not all launchers are "hoarded" now,
  so if you remove a launcher it will delete the .desktop file. Prolly should
  only delete hoarded launchers.

* Migrate some of the old global settings to the new per-toplevel version of
  the settings.

* Changed how drawers are saved - there should be no drawer toplevels in
  the toplevel_id_list and drawer toplevels should only be loaded when
  you come across a attached_toplevel_id for a drawer.
