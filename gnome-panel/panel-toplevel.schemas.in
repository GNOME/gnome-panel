          This is a human readable name which you can use to identify
          a panel. Its main purpose is to serve as the panel's window
          title which is useful when navigating between panels.

          can only be placed at a screen edge. If false, the panel

          The orientation of the panel. Possible values are "top",

          important - both indicate that this is a horizontal panel -
          but still give a useful hint as to how some panel objects
          should behave. For example, on a "top" panel a menu button
          will pop up its menu below the panel, whereas on a "bottom"
          panel the menu will be popped up above the panel.
