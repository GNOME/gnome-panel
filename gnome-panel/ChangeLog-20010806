Tue Jan 13 16:14:13 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel.c,main.c: reversed x and y loading for vertical panel. the
	  initial loading is done through a "stack" so applets are added
	  in the right order it seems.

Tue Jan 13 15:41:01 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel.c: will now handle all four positions for the geometry

	  also I added an "autoraise" which helps it keep it on top

Mon Jan 12 22:28:40 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* panel.[ch]: the "colision avoidance" of applets now works, even
	  when adding new applets to the panel. There is now a hide button

	more generic.  It should now be easy to create new clock styles.

	* panel.c (save_applet_configuration): The panel was not
	incrementing the unique numeric key correctly.
