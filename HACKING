Hi,

As we are getting very close to the 1.2 release, I'd like people not to
commit to gnome-core or gnome-applets without first getting approval from
either George (jirka@5z.com) or me (jacob@helixcode.com).  Translators and
doc people are exempted from this, of course.  I will update the HACKING
files accordingly.

This hopefully won't last long as my list of things to before 1.2 is
getting short these days.

Thanks,
Jacob
