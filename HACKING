Hacking the GNOME 2.0 core
--------------------------

	At the present, not much here works very well and help is
needed.

	If you want to hack on this module - welcome. Before you start
committing patches though, try to sync up with George, Jacob, myself,
Glynn and Alex so we know who's working on what.
